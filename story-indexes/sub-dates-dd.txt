Barrier: MBAC-112
CBL: 02C-465; 02C-502
Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: [unknown]; [Carl Barks]
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1952, March 31
Publication date: 1952, November-December
Issue: Donald Duck 26
Pages: 23

Additional credits: Comic-book adaption of Donald Duck cartoon "Trick or Treat".

Changes: Shortened from 32 pages to 23 pages. For the version as published, Barks made one-and-a-half page of new art. Detailed information

Surviving material: CS DD 26 Trick or Treat [surviving cut material]

Lost material: CZ DD 26 Trick or Treat [lost cut material]

CBL-notes: (R) A change due to the reconstruction of the story, which was cut down by the Western editors to 23 pages instead of 32. On page 1, the caption of panel 2 is shortened. The caption as by Western is not shown, but its text is mentioned in accompanying article.
Colored, except for the one-and-a-half page of new art which is printed apart from the (reconstructed) story, and some individual panels.
In the un-colored reproduction of the original panel 1.1 on page 02C-504, the upper panel border is different from the colored version on page 02C-465.

Reconstructions: In The Carl Barks Library - Set II, the story is reconstructed as a 32 pager, filling in the gap of the missing panel by a 'new' one, using art from other scenes in the comic. One caption was shortened, reconstructing it as it might have been in the original version. (The new one-and-a half page opening sequence with Donald and the nephews, is published in an article accompanying the story.)

Research: In English, "hazel" is the name of both a shrub native to eastern north america and an over-the-counter remedy for bruises and sprains (although not recognized in pharmacy as having much value).

Congruences:

... Student Witch
    derby-hatted ogre

Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1952, April 10
Publication date: 1952, November-December
Issue: Donald Duck 26
Pages: 1

Changes: Panel 7 was shortened in width by Western to make room for a narrow text box calling attention to a cut-out Halloween mask on the comic's back cover: "Turn the page for your Donald Duck startler." As a result, Daisy's eyes look past Donald.

Status: Original version is lost.

CBL-notes: (R) Panel 7 is stretched in width a little to reconstruct Barks' original layout.

Reconstructions: The Carl Barks Library - Set II has reconstructed the original lay-out by adding more space in between Donald and Daisy.
"The Carl Barks Library of Donald Duck Adventures in Color No. 25" is reported to contain a better reconstruction.

Changes: Written and drawn as an 8 page story "but the editors whittled it down to fit a speciale hole in a rush. In the process they got some panels reversed on the bottom half of page 5, leaving the story a bad jumbled mess." (letter from Barks to a fan) Detailed information

Lost material:

Status: No cut art is known to have surfaced.

CBL-notes: (R) On page 5, tier 3 and 4 (panels 7-8 and 5-6) are switched to reconstruct Barks' original intention. Western mixed up these tiers while cutting out two pages of artwork from the story.

Reconstructions: The Carl Barks Library - Set II the panels of the last page are printed in the right order.

Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1954, September 30
Publication date: 1956, March-April
Issue: Donald Duck 46
Pages: 24

Changes: On several occasions in this story, as published in The Carl Barks Library - Set II, the word "spirit" looks out of sync with the rest of the dialogue, as if it was drawn by someone else after Barks' writing had been erased, replacing a smaller word. From the story context it looks like that "god" rather than "spirit" was the original word.

Status: If changed, the original version is lost.

Questions: Is the original publication identical to the reprint in The Carl Barks Library - Set II?

Correspondence:

    June 22, 1956 letter from Chase Craig to Carl Barks

Schedule: Originally scheduled for "Walt Disney's Comics and Stories" No. 203, August 1957. In a letter dated June 22, 1956, about a week after the story's submission, Chase Craig informed Barks of the change and asked for another ten-page story for "Walt Disney's Comics and Stories".

Questions: At this time, Barks' stories for "Walt Disney's Comics and Stories" were untitled. So, maybe the title "Lost Peg Leg Mine" was both made up and lettered by the editors?
