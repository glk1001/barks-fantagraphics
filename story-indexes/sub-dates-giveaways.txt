W CGW 1-01 Donald Duck's Atom Bomb

Barrier: MBAC-101
CBL: 06A-143
Type: story, one tier per page
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1946, September 9
Publication date: 1947
Issue: Chreerios Premium Y1
Pages: 30

Layout: 30 one-tier pages with generally three panels a tier, equivalent to 7 1/2 four-tier pages.

CBL-notes: Redrawn, relettered and censored. Daan Jippes' redrawn four-tier version is pasted into the original one-tier lay-out, which can be clearly be seen in panel 29.3. Panel 7.1, panel 14.3 and panels 25.2 and 25.3 are not redrawn by Jippes. Other redrawn (or at least retouched) panels are used here, which are closer to the original. Lots of backgrounds are different from Jippes' version, but closer to the original.

On page 16, the truncheon of a police-man is changed into handcuffs (which is already the case in Jippes' version).

Both panels on page 30 are censored. Originally, Donald had "got a way picked out to make money - and lots of it!" and went selling an "atomic hair-grower" at 100 dollar a bottle. In this censored version, Donald has "more than money in mind" and gives away free samples of a normal hair-grower. The word "atomic" is removed from the board, but most noticable are the cash register being replaced for a pyramid of bottles and the people in the queue having combs in their hands instead of bank-notes.

Submission: 1946, March 8
Publication date: 1946

Pages: 8

CBL-notes: Heavily retouched and relettered. The editors must have used a very bad source, since a lot of originally bold lettered words are gone in the new lettering.
The Carl Barks Library of 1940s Donald Duck Christmas Giveaways in Color No. 1 has a more detailed reproduction quality, but it looks as being retouched often. Could this a redrawn version? Contains bold lettering. (Does this bold lettering fully match with the original publication?)

Questions: Do you have information on the source of the reprint in The Carl Barks Library of 1940s Donald Duck Christmas Giveaways in Color No. 1?

CBL-notes: Retouching occurs throughout the story, most noticable in Donald's face in the bottom half of page 3 and in panel 7.4.

In The Carl Barks Library of 1940s Donald Duck Christmas Giveaways in Color No. 1, the retouching of panel 3.8 is a bit better (although in the original artwork Donald's beak couldn't be seen entirely because of the water falling on it). The ugly eye of Donald in panel 7.4 is still there.

Changes: If "The Carl Barks Library - Set VI" has printed the story as it first appeared, then something must have happened before the story saw print, because some of the expressions on the ducks' faces look as if they're drawn by someone other than Barks. Detailed information

Publication date: 1954, [November]
Issue: Donald Duck Tells About Kites [Florida Power comic]
Pages: 8 [same number as Tells About Kites [Southern California story]]

Additional credits: Three editions of the 1954 giveaway comic "Donald Duck Tells About Kites" are known to exist. Reportedly, this version is virtually identical to Tells About Kites [Southern California story], with one minor variation in the text. (What? Where?) Reportedly, panels 7.3, 7.4, and 8.3, are different from Tells About Kites [Pacific Gas story]. (Reportedly, panel 7.1 differs in length, but the art itself appears to be the very same.)
Barks's vouchers contain confusing information about the work that has been done for this story.
More information, and a more detailed comparison

Changes: It's difficult to determine if this is a changed or original version, and if changes where made by Barks or by the editor (or both). It largely depends on what happened (or didn't happen) with Tells About Kites [Pacific Gas story] and Tells About Kites [Southern California story].

Questions: Do you have scans of this story as published in Donald Duck Tells About Kites [Florida Power comic]?
Do you know more than what is mentioned here? Unnoticed differences with the versions in the other two editions, for example? And which of them is the original one, on which the other versions are based?

Submission: [1954, June 17, and 1954, July 8]
Publication date: 1954, [November]
Issue: Donald Duck Tells About Kites [Pacific Gas comic]
Pages: 8 [in fact only three panels?]

Additional credits: Three editions of the 1954 giveaway comic "Donald Duck Tells About Kites" are known to exist. Panels 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, and 8.3 of this version are different from the virtually identical other two versions, which are Tells About Kites [Florida Power story] and Tells About Kites [Southern California story]. (Panel 7.1 differs in length, but there's no extra art.) According to a caption in the bottom-left corner of panel 1.1, this story is "published as a public service by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company".
Barks's vouchers contain confusing information about the work that has been done for this story.
More information, and a more detailed comparison

Description: (Description of page 7 and panel 8.3, as published in the D.O.N.A.L.D.-internal magazine "Mitteilungen für Mitglieder".)
The kite gets caught in the power line (panel 7.1), and a nephew penciles down "rule no 6", which warns for kites getting caught in power lines (panel 7.2). Reportedly, this is very same material in all three versions.
Then, in panel 7.3, Donald suddenly discovers a broken power line hanging down, and he warns that "we'll have to notify P. G. and E. immediately" (panel 7.3).
Then, in panel 7.4, Donald looks up and comments: "Even with the best of care, power lines sometimes break! If you find one, always report it!" Two nephews say: "We'll stay here to see that nobody touches the wire!" The third nephew walks towards a phone booth, saying: "And I'll phone P. G. and E. right away!"
Panel 7.5 shows a close-up of a nephew having penciled another note, saying "And that's rule number seven!" The note reads "Never touch fallen electric wires, report them to P. G. and E. or to your parents".
Panel 7.6 appears to be the same material in all three versions. It shows the ducks in an open park.
Panel 8.3 shows eight rules (instead of seven). It has no bottom panel-border. All papers, and almost all of their shadows, are fullly shown. The eighth rule and its paper are identical to the seventh rule in Tells About Kites [Southern California story], except for the numbering. (The rule reads: "Never let a kite go over radio or TV aerials".) The paper of current rule number seven is not shown in Tells About Kites [Southern California story]. (The rule reads: "Never touch electric wires".)

Changes: The caption in the bottom-left corner of panel 1.1 seems to be added. (Or is there a similar caption in the other two editions as well?) Panel 7.1 appears to be heightened by moving the bottom panel-border down, adding more whitespace below Donald's feet, in order to make them fit with panels 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5. If panel 7.1 is not changed here, then a change has been made in panel 7.1 of Tells About Kites [Florida Power story] and/or Tells About Kites [Southern California story].
It's difficult to determine if this is a changed or original version, and if changes where made by Barks or by the editor (or both). It largely depends on what happened (or didn't happen) with Tells About Kites [Florida Power story] and Tells About Kites [Southern California story].

CBL-notes: Only three panels have been printed. They replace panels 7.3 and 7.4 of Tells About Kites [Southern California story]. Redrawn, or at least heavily retouched. The dialogue is taken from the original publication, or relettered, maybe both.

Notes: Reprinted in monochrome xerox-quality in the German D.O.N.A.L.D.-internal magazine "Mitteilungen für Mitglieder" (bulletin for members of D.O.N.A.L.D.) edition of October, 1982 (published by Elke Imberger).

Questions: Do you have scans of this story as published in Donald Duck Tells About Kites [Pacific Gas comic]?
Do you know more than what is mentioned here? Unnoticed differences with the versions in the other two editions, for example? And which of them is the original one, on which the other versions are based?

Then, in panel 7.3, Donald shows a phone booth to two of the nephews, saying: "Here's what to do! Call the electric company and they'll send a lineman to get your kite down for you!" The third nephew penciles a note, but that could be a continuation of the previous panel.
Panel 7.4 has the width of the page, as wide as two normal panels. At the left, under panel 7.1, it has a small extension on top. A caption reads "Later...", and the art shows a lineman giving back the kite to the nephews, witnessed by a Donald.
Panel 7.6 appears to be the same material in all three versions. It shows the ducks in an open park.
Panel 8.3 shows seven rules (instead of eight). The paper of the seventh rule, and it's shadow, are partly shown. (It stops at the bottom panel-border.) The seventh rule and its paper are identical to the eighth rule in Tells About Kites [Pacific Gas story], except for the numbering. (The rule reads: "Never let a kite go over radio or TV aerials".) The paper of the eighth rule in Tells About Kites [Pacific Gas story], is not included.

Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1947, September 26
Publication date: 1948
Issue: Boys' and Girls' March of Comics 20
Pages: 24

CBL-notes: Redrawn, relettered and censored. Pages 1 to 5 and page 10 are redrawn by Daan Jippes, the other pages are redrawn by Dick Vlottes. Jippes and Vlottes followed the original and did not do the censoring (except for leaving out panel 15.3).

The faces of the natives are changed, thick lips and pointed teeth are removed. Original panel 15.3 is removed. It pictured two cannibals showing their pointed teeth, saying that they'll eat the ducks at moonrise if the professor doesn't tell them to let go. Panel 15.4 is extended in width to fill the gap. The dialogue is changed at various places, references to cannibals are removed. Originally, the cannibals were bribed with "two false teeth", in the censored version they get "confederate dollars".

Notes: Barks later made a new version of this story, titled Donald Duck in "Forbidden Valley".

Submission: 1948, December 15

CBL-notes: Redrawn by Daan Jippes, directly into the Dutch language (as he usually or always) did. This is visible in panel 2.4, where the name "Dagobert" appears on the lawyer's note instead of "Scrooge". In panel 8.2, the name "Kwaak" appears on the boat instead of "Quack". Dialogue is taken from the original comic or relettered, most likely both.

Originally, the natives all had black hair (except the mayor on page 14) while Jippes left their hair blank. Besides this, the story has no (intended) differences with the original.
