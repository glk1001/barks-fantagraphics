Trivia: In panel 3.4, Donald mentions the sum of Scrooge's money. ("$ 500, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000. 16")

Backstage: In an August 1978 letter to Michael Barrier, Barks told that Garé - who had begun working as his assistant only shortly before - suggested the locale for this story, and told him about the menehunes.

In [1961], collector Malcolm Willits asked Barks to give titles for stories that originally were published without a title. In a January 17, 1962 letter to Willits, Barks suggested some off-the-cuff titles. The one he gave to this story was "Hawaiian Hideaway".

Animated adaption: The Land of Trala La

Trivia: Scrooge hates his money (3.2).

Backstage: In a March 8, 1968 letter to Dick Blackburn, Barks wrote: "As for the 'Shangri La' story, which poked fun at the idea of humans living together in unselfish Utopian harmony, it started from my efforts to find a way to use one BILLION of something in a visible way. The bottle cap gag was the result."

In [1961], collector Malcolm Willits asked Barks to give titles for stories that originally were published without a title. In a January 17, 1962 letter to Willits, Barks suggested some off-the-cuff titles. The one he gave to this story was "Hoopla in Shangri La" [sic].

Details: The inhabitants of Tralla La have five fingers per hand (which is unusual in the Disney universe).

Additional credits: Page 12 contains a caricature of Al Koch. In a June 1968 letter to Michael Barrier, Barks wrote about Al Koch: "He is the guy who led me to a bluff near Thousand Palms and showed me the ancient Indian trail that started the sequence of ideas that became the plot of the Seven Cities story. Al and I 'developed' the plot that evening over copious draughts of bourbon and ale."

Landmark: First appearance of 176-301 (12.3); 176-360 (12.3); 176-111 (12.3); 176-602 (12.4); 176-671 (12.4); 176-001 (13.1); 176-331 (22.4); 176-616 (22.5); and 176-176 (22.6).

Appearances: Beagle Boys / Beagle Boys Inc. / Beagle Boys, Inc. (12.3).

Backstage: In [1961], collector Malcolm Willits asked Barks to give titles for stories that originally were published without a title. In a January 17, 1962 letter to Willits, Barks suggested some off-the-cuff titles. The one he gave to this story was "The Seven Cities of Gold".

Research: Carl Barks' tale of the Seven Cities combines both legend and history. Detailed information

Correspondence:

    January 17, 1962 letter from Carl Barks to Malcolm Willits
    June 1968 letter from Carl Barks to Michael Barrier
    February 25, 1976 letter from Carl Barks to Marty and Elouise Martin

Questions: In panel 9.6, a vase falls apart from a nephew's hands. It's filled with jewels, but Scrooge doesn't seem impressed. Instead, he only answers the nephews' observing that the vase fell apart, saying its "No wonder!"
In panel 9.7, all the ducks gather around the vase's contents and Donald states they're "beads and jewels and ornaments of heavy gold!"
In panel 9.8, Scrooge suddenly jumps over the jewels greedily, saying "Let me have a look at that stuff! I'm an expert on gold!
In panel 10.1, Scrooge holds the contents of the broken vase in his hands and says "It's real, boys! And the design shows it's at least a thousand years old!"

The timing of Donald being the first to identify the vase's contents, followed up by Scrooge's sudden excitement, might seem a bit strange and hints at a possible change made by Barks after having inked the story (or at least this scene). If so, then there are several possibilities of what might have happened.

Possibility 1: Perhaps Barks looked over the story and decided to make this theoretical scene a bit more visual by inserting the excited Scrooge into it.

Possibility 2: Perhaps Scrooge has been redrawn over a previous Scrooge, that maybe, was already excited by the sight of the jewels. Maybe Barks, re-reading it, decided to add panel 9.7, and had to change Scrooge in panel 9.6 to be consistent with the following panels.

Possibility 3: Perhaps Barks originally had Donald in panel 9.6 instead of Scrooge. If that were the case, it could have been Donald in panel 9.6 saying, "No Wonder!" and then in panel 9.7 Donald continues to speak, saying "It was filled with beads and jewels and ornaments of heavy gold," thus completing the earlier statement. This has better continuity, at least as far as the dialog is concerned. Perhaps, Barks may have drawn Donald out and inserted Scrooge to make the scene better support the action in the following panels.

Additional notes: The action of the excited Scrooge in panel 9.8 looks like panel 5.8. Maybe Barks found that Scrooge would become too impulsive/over-enthusiastic in case of "possibility" 2 and 3? Two of such impulsive Scrooge scenes (page 5 and 9) might have made Scrooge's interaction in the story too one-dimensional. With panel 9.7 in between panels 9.6 and 9.8, Scrooge's enthusiasm is "explained better" than without panel 9.7. Perhaps another, additional reason could be that Barks wanted to pad the scene, with for example a half page worth of material, because otherwise the visit to the professor would follow too soon?

In case of possibility 3, the story was changed without nescessarily having an effect on the length of the scene (or the story). If the only change would have been replacing Donald by Scrooge, then I think that Scrooge in panel 9.8 might have looked too much as if he jumps out of nowhere. Now, with Scrooge on the foreground in panel 9.6 (instead of Donald), Scrooge's jump in panel 9.8 looks visually more "balanced" to me.

Backstage: In [1961], collector Malcolm Willits asked Barks to give titles for stories that originally were published without a title. In a January 17, 1962 letter to Willits, Barks suggested some off-the-cuff titles. The one he gave to this story was "Message From Mysterious Island".

Cross-references: 176-167 thinks of having prunes for breakfast. (25.6) Other Beagles protest: "Shut up! We had prunes for breakfast every morning in prison! Are you getting homesick?" (25.7) Then, 176-167 humbly admits: "But I like prunes!" (25.7) The stories «The Giant Robot Robbers» and «Horsing Around With History [story]» contain cross-references to this confession.

Cross-references: The cookie says: "Here comes that old skinflint, Scrooge McDuck! He's always figuring ways to get free coffee!" (1.1) This is a cross-reference to «half a cup of coffee», where Scrooge tries to get half a cup for a nickel. The gag W US 12-03 standard size cup also contains a cross-reference to Scrooge's attempts to get his cups of coffee cheap.

Lost material:

Land Beneath the Ground! [lost cut material]

CBL-notes: (R) Changes due to reconstruct some the survived art that was cut out of the story before its first print. On panel 5 of page 4 (panel 1 of page 4 in the first print) the text (and the size?) of the caption is altered. On panel 5 of page 6 (panel 5 of page 5 in the first print), the dialogue is slightly changed and a paste-up shadow is removed. The latter is explained by the footnote: "In the original edition of 1956 and subsequent printing by Western Publishing, a thin line of shadow appears just beneath the first dialogue balloon in panel 5. It has been cleaned up in the current printing." The original panels are not shown, but their texts are mentioned in accompanying article.

To make the inserting of a surviving half page possible (as the first half of page 4), a caption is added in its first panel. To make this caption fit in the artwork, the layout of the panel is changed. The original panel is shown in the accompanying article.

Changes: Barks originally used Donald, but had to change him into a different character because of Western's applying for a second class mailing permit for the "Uncle Scrooge" comic.

Barks-Barrier, 1969 list: "The four-page Gyro stories for Uncle S. #13 and #14 were sent back to me for changes. In the #13 story I'd used the nephews. Because of postal mailing laws, no characters used in other parts of the book could be used in the Gyro story. Hence the change to Mickey's nephews. The character 'Speedy' in #14 was originally Donald."

Speedy's black leather jacket and his cap still resembles a sailor suit. The only change made to Donald's car seems to be the license plate number. Panel 2.8 has a blanco license plate. In panel 4.2, the license plate number is "313". In panel 4.6, the license plate number is "818".

In the dialogue of panels 1.8, 2.1, 3.1, 3.3, 3.7, 4.2, and 4.6, references to Donald are changed into "Speedy". (It might be interesting to note that both names contain 6&nbsletters.)

Status: Original version is lost.

Intended issue: Uncle Scrooge [Uncle Scrooge 16 ?]
Intended publication date: [1957, December-February ?]

Description: Art only front cover for "Uncle Scrooge", listed as "piggy bank dog", submitted on May 24, 1956. According to "Michael Barrier", Barks remembers this cover as one in which Scrooge was pulling a piggy bank along the street on a leash, as if it were a dog.

Submission date falls in between the submission dates of the covers that appeared on Uncle Scrooge 15 and Uncle Scrooge 17, so a guess could be that this cover would have appeared on or around Uncle Scrooge 16. (Submission date of the cover that did appear on Uncle Scrooge 16 is unknown.)

Status: As far as known, the cover has never surfaced.

CBL-notes: The Brutopians' high cheekbones are removed. On panel 6 of page 3, the phrase "rich pig of a duck" is changed to "rich dog of a duck."
Years later, the story has been reprinted uncensored in Uncle Scrooge McDuck by Carl Barks - Uncle Scrooge Adventures 17.

Research: The reference to kitchen sinks refers to the American idiom "everything including the kitchen sink", which means "everything", in an emphatic way. In this story, Barks had the Brutopian literally bid everything his country had, including the kitchen sink.

Backstage: Barks portrayed many of his lost tribes as pygmies. "That makes a slight menace out of the ducks...," he explained in a 24 September 1983 interview by Bruce Hamilton. "They were always peewees in comparison with the villains. In order for them to become a menace, they had to come up against somebody smaller."

Research: The Peeweegah dialogue in this story was written in the heavy rhythm of "The Song of Hiawatha". When Longfellow wrote that work, he had in mind the Finnish epic "The Kalevala", which was also written in that very catchy two-step rhythm.

Congruences:

W OS 62-03 in Mystery of the Swamp
    The vandalized campsite and migrating canoe, the posted warning and shower of arrows, the powwow around the bonfire, the kidnapped pygmy, the flight through the waterways, Donald's ordeal by combat, and the drugged offering - in this case an Indian peace pipe dropped with oxide of Strombolium.
    "That gave me pause for a while," Barks has said, "but I realized that only the plotline was similar; all other elements were breaking new ground. Besides, the pygmy Indians were more believable and interesting than the Gneezles, so I went ahead with the story and let the gags fall where they might."

CBL-notes: Scrooge's coat is shaded with dots.

Research: Just for the benefit of people who may have seen pictures of the Potomac River, or the river itself, and who are wondering how George Washington could have thrown a dollar across such a wide body of water: he didn't. The story is a popular misconception. When he was a youth, Washington lived on the banks of the Rhappahanock River, and he threw a dollar across it, to demonstrate his strength. That river (at least where Washington lived) is much narrower than the Potomac (where Washington eventually ended up, building his estate "Mount Vernon" on its banks).

Pages: 26

Changes: One page was cut by Barks himself. Perhaps on looking over this story after he had finished it, Barks thought it could use a couple of more gags and a little less straight business, so he chopped a page of straight stuff and added a page of gags. Detailed information

Surviving material: CX US 22 The Golden River [surviving cut material]

CBL-notes: Page cut by Barks himself, is placed back (as page 17) into the story. To make this possible, panel 1 of page 17 in the story's first print (now page 18) is removed. This art is published apart from the story.

Research: Panel 3.8 is one of the instances in which Scrooge gets rid of people by using a lever which opens a floor trapdoor in front of his office desk. The British "Monty Python's Flying Circus" comedians use a similar joke in a sketch called "Merchant Banker" (4th episode of their 3rd television series, broadcasted from October 19, 1972 to January 18, 1973).

Cross-references: Second appearance of Flintheart Glomgold. At first, Scrooge thinks that Flintheart must be a mad stranger. Then, Flintheart refreshes the Ducks' memories by saying: "I almost defeated McDuck in a contest once in Africa!" (3.4) After this explanation, one nephew remembers Flintheart by saying: "When he and Unca Scrooge matched wealth, Unca Scrooge won by having saved more string in his lifetime!" (3.6) And Donald adds: "We helped them unroll string for days up through the heart of Africa!" (3.6) These memories are cross-references to what happened during Flintheart's first appearance, in «in "The Second-richest Duck"».

Backstage: In a letter to John Spicer of circa May 1960, Barks wrote about the construction of the story: "There are some bad spots in some of those stories [the Uncle Scrooge adventures] that I wish could have been done over. The climax fight in the recent Paul Bunyan theme could have been improved with a half-page spread of Scrooge's and the B. Boys' giant machines hacking each other to pieces, but I was afraid the editors would delete such a scene as being too violent."

Research: In 1996, there was a discussion on the origin of Paul Bunyan on the Disney comics Mailing List. Detailed information

Surviving material: page 5 - alternate 3rd tier An alternate third tier for page 5 exists, which is replaced by a new one in the story. published in an article in The Carl Barks Library - Set IV. In the alternate version, the two Spanish boys are only described; in the published version they are shown.

Backstage: In a letter to Malcolm Willits of 30 December 1960, Barks explained "why I padded the Poncey de Loon story by having Uncle Scrooge tell it to Grandma. ...I was trying to get a little variety in the opening. It seemed to me from the business involved that the reader needed to be aware that Scrooge would find the Fountain of Youth. That Fountain would have seemed awfully phony if it were dragged into the story along about page 8. Grandma was the gimmick that helped plant the fountain early."

CBL-notes: In panel 7.7, the heads of the natives have been changed. Instead of curly black hair, they now have punk hairstyles, horned helmets and bald heads. Interesting to note is that Barks himself did the redrawing of this panel, at the request of the Carl Barks Library editors (the censoring itself was of course not their decision!).
On panels 8.1 and 8.3, the bone through Old Boogerbooboo's nose is removed. In panel 8.2, the two Qwak Qwak have bald heads instead of curly hair. The dialogue is changed at several places, references to rebels, Mau Maus and vooodoo are removed.
Donald's glasses in panel 10.7 are removed.

Trivia: Scrooge is "determined he's going to make Unca Donald the next tycoon of the vast McDuck Empire." (panel 1.1)

Pages: 14

Changes: A total of two pages was cut to make room for ads. Detailed information

Lost material: CZ US 34 Mythtic Mystery [lost cut material]

Status: Original version is lost.

Backstage: Barks had originally planned to do a story with a plot revolving around an Aswan-type dam, but decided it would come too soon after "Pipeline to Danger" (US 30), another story with a Middle Eastern desert setting.

Barks, in a December 30, 1960 letter to Malcom Willits: "In its place I wrote a 16-pager of Uncle Scrooge and the ducks getting blown into Valhalla (a wandering small planet that strays into the earth's shadow). This Valhalla is peopled by dog-faces named Thor, Odin, and other names common to the Norse Gods. Also Vulcan, Jupiter, Venus, and the Latin Gods names. You'll have to read Uncle Scrooge #34 to see how I explain away such mythical anomalies with scientifically provable hogwash. As Louie expresses it: "Another of childhood's cherished illusions reduced to so many nuts and bolts."

Research: In panel 5.1, Scrooge refers to the old Norse myths. The term "Norse" doesn't refer specifically to Norway. It's a term used for the ancient cultures of the Scandinavian countries (and Iceland).

Mythic Mystery was altered by a Danish publisher in the early 1960愀. (Anders And & Co. 1962-28?) Thor愀 horses were changed into more accurate goats, which is what they should be.

Description: Scrooge takes a contract to move the ancient Egyptian palaces and statues that are threatened with flooding by the Aswan Dam. He finds a hidden shaft leading down into the bowels of history, and therein finds uncountable tons of sparklers.

Surviving material: Three letters mentioning the story; and 1985 notes for The Carl Barks Library.

Status: No work for this story is known to have survived. In a May 12, 2000 e-mail, Kim Weston wrote: "The Aswan Dam story was never fully scripted. It was scrapped before any story art was done, although I suppose it is possible that Barks could have done some sketches for himself; other examples of such studies exist."

Reconstructions: If Barks' Uncle Scrooge adventures in and around "Uncle Scrooge" No. 34 are representable, then the Aswan Dam story would have had a length of about 16 pages. Using Barks' comments from two of his letters to Malcolm Willits gives an idea what scenes the story may have contained if it had been finished:

    Scrooge takes a contract to move the ancient Egyptian palaces and statues that are threatened with flooding by the Aswan Dam.
    His way of raising ancient statues and temples above the future level of the water is by a method "as fully as wacky" as the methods which turned out to be planned in reality.
    He finds a hidden shaft leading down into the bowels of history, and therein finds uncountable tons of sparklers.
    The rains come early to the Ethiopian high-lands, the Nile toward the newly completed dam. The shaft and all the toiling ducks in the awesome treasure pits will be submerged as the roiling torrent slams against the unyielding barrier of the towering new dam.
    The question raises if Scrooge will get the rocks out of the cellar in time, he discovers that - Ha! - he's already in the 110% income tax bracket.

Backstage: Barks had originally planned to do a story for "Uncle Scrooge" No. 34 with a plot revolving around an Aswan-type dam. Detailed information

The Midas Touch / Duckburg's Day of Peril / Safe [penciled title lettering]

Backstage: Joseph Cowles wrote in a July 29, 2000 e-mail:

    You've quoted (WDC 263-01) from a Barks letter written to me. I knew he was ultra-organized when it came to keeping records about his work, but didn't realize that he kept copies of his letters to me. Was it a photocopy or a carbon copy? Probably a carbon, back in those days.

    The reason I'm so interested is that one of the letters he wrote me has long since gone the way of all good things. I would sure like to find a copy of it. It was where he was telling me that he been working on development of a new character to act as an additional foil for Scrooge: the Sorceress. If you have any idea of how I could get my paws on a copy of that letter please let me know.

Cross-references: «Ten-cent Valentine» contains a cross-reference.

Questions: Does someone know if and where a copy of this lost letter has been published?

W US 39-02 A Spicy Tale

My rare wild nutmegs from the upper Amazon!

Submission: 1962, January 15

Pages: 18

Changes: In panel 18.8, the lettering of the word "fibber" and the spacing before and after it indicate that it replaced an original text written by Barks. It's unclear if this change was made before or after the story's submission. Possibly, Scrooge's comment originally contained a reference to his nutmeg tea addiction.

Status: If changed, no original version is known to exist.

Backstage:

    In a January 17, 1962 letter to Malcom Willits, Barks wrote that the story "takes a gentle poke at the Peace Corps - but gentle. I'm running out of nations which aren't fighting or rioting or committing aggression. So this story's locale was the Jivaro Indian country, which I've used to death, along with their head-shrinking gimmick."
    In a May 29, 1973 interview by Donald Ault, Barks told about the story's gimmick of Scrooge being addicted to nutmeg tea.

Detailed information

Research: In 1985 or so it was the rage to brand any comic that mentioned drugs in any fashion as a "drug" issue. Apparently, this seemed more like a ploy among speculators as an excuse to charge more for that particular issue. "A Spicy Tale" was a drug issue because Scrooge was addicted to nutmeg. The Overstreet Price Guide lists several Barks comics as drug issues, like W WDC 112-02 rip van winkle and W OS 328-02 in Old California!.

Animated adaption: The Status Seekers

Backstage: Barks: ". . . There's been come changes in the drawing size and lettering style of all Whitman comics. It's got me and all the other artists mad and confused. Perhaps by the middle of the month I'll have some shining examples of the new format to show you. Right now I'm writing a 20 page Scrooge. Believe me, you're smart if you've decided to seek your fortune in other fields than cartooning . . . ." (27 April 1962 letter to Joseph Cowles) Detailed information

Cross-references: When Scrooge tries to hide the Candy-striped Ruby by putting it in a batch of peppermint candy, 176-761 says: "You remember one time Scrooge almost fooled us by making gold nuggets look like corn!" (17.6) This is a cross-reference to what happened a few years earlier, in «All at Sea».

Research: The title "For Old Dime's Sake" is based on the phrasing "for old times' sake". The meaning of "for old times' sake" is hard to define, but means roughly -- "because of past pleasurable experiences." For example, if you were to ask a favor of someone you had once known well, but had not contacted them for many years, you might ask them to grant the favor in memory of the good times of the past -- "for old times' sake."

Research: This story is based on the traditional Christmas song "The Twelve Days of Christmas". There seem to be two other versions of the song, of which the authors are known. The first version has "a possum in a gum tree" (Milne / Chick, copyright Milne) and the second has "an emu up a gum tree" (Bolt / Williams, copyright Williams). Detailed information

Changes: According to a surviving cover pencil, the title of this story was to have been "Rug Bugs in Old Bugdud".
According to Barks' work records, this story was written and drawn as a 17-pager. It was published as a 16-pager. In March 25, 1989 notes for "The Carl Barks Library", Barks describes the cut as "a gag sequence of the ducks chasing east after Magica, who runs out of 'fuel' and has to land the carpet in the desert. That would have been about page 13. No doubt readers got more pleasure from the Bullwinkle Cheerios ad that was made possible by the scrapping of that page."

Lost material: CZ US 50 Rug Riders in the Sky [lost cut material]

Surviving material: CS US 51 How Green Was My Lettuce [surviving cut material]

Lost material: CZ US 51 How Green Was My Lettuce [lost cut material]

CBL-notes: (R) Balloons are added, altered and deleted in the first reconstructed two pages, to fit in surviving unpublished art that was cut out by Western. Also, the silhouette of Scrooge is deleted from the first print's panel 8 of page 2. A full explanation is given in an article, where the first print's page 2 is shown.

Reconstructions: The survived material is published in The Carl Barks Library - Set V by putting it back in the story. To make this possible, changes were made to art that was possibly altered / added by the Western editors. The word balloon "Wak! Gophers!" in panel 4 of page 2 has been deleted because the next sequence in the excised portion reveals that Scrooge does not yet know about the gophers. The words "Now what?" in Scrooge's dialogue in panel 5 of published page 2 have been changed to "Suddenly," because he has just exclaimed "Wak! Now what?" in the cut previous panel. A small black dot, intended to represent Scrooge running from his bin, has been whited out of panel 7 of published page 2. In this panel, an additional dialogue balloon has been given to one of the nephews. He now asks "Where's Unca Scrooge?" because Donald's dialogue in the cut next panel is, "I don't see him, but there's a two-ton sack of money coming out of the door!" The still missing quarter-page is represented by a blank box in between first and third tier of restored page 2, where it logically seems to have been.
For the comic reprint in Uncle Scrooge 241, Don Rosa created a new tier to fill the gap.

Additional credits: Barks's records show him receiving payment for both the art and the idea for this page, but he has said, "I am not sure, but I think this was drawn for a gag that was sent to me by the office. I never used [Ludwig] von Drake except when asked to." (September 11, 1973 letter from Carl Barks to Michael Barrier)

Landmark: First (and last) appearance of Ludwig von Drake.

Backstage: Ludwig von Drake was introduced on the Disney television program in the fall of 1961, just a few weeks before Barks submitted this page, so it seems likely that the gag was part of an effort by Disney and Western to promote the character.

Correspondence:

    September 11, 1973 letter from Carl Barks to Michael Barrier

Questions: Does someone know the exact date of Ludwig von Drake's debut on television, and the title of that program?

Cross-references: One nephew says: "It seems to me I remember one of the Beagle Boys had a weakness, but I can't recall what it was!" (16.7) This weakness turns out to be that "one of the Beagle Boys can't resist the smell of prunes! (17.7) This is a cross-reference to «message from uncharted island», where 176-167 admits his fondness of prunes.
The story «Horsing Around With History [story]» also contains a cross-reference to this confession.

Surviving material: Original art of all 24 pages.

Appearances: file 90L-6F (6.3)

Research: In panel 1.1, the caption reads: "Uncle Scrooge losing his fortune in a desperate dog sled race against the wiliest rogue north of nome? How did he get into such a snafu?" "Snafu" is military slang for "situation normal, all fouled up". It was first used by U.S. soldiers during World War II. Most people (but maybe not when Barks wrote it) probably know that "fouled" is a euphemism for an originally stronger word. In the 1950s, with its original use still a fairly recent memory, the company now known as Marvel Comics used "snafu" as the title of a children's comic book. Possibly, though opinions differ, "snafu" is swell now. Swell is slang that's so outdated it's humorous to use it, a little tongue-in-cheek (i.e. slightly humorously/sarcastically).

Status: The synopsis has never surfaced.

Backstage: When Barks submitted a synopsis for this story, which showed the Beagle Boys learning new crime techniques in prison school, Barks received a worried letter (dated 9 July 1965) from Chase Craig, his editor. Detailed information

Updates: NAFS(k)uriren #32 contains a picture of Göran Broling and Carl Barks, holding a frame with the original artwork of page 14. The page was shown during a 1994 meeting with Barks in Sweden.

Questions: At this moment, I have no idea on the exact whereabouts of how Barks submitted his material to his editors. So, I don't know if this was the only occasion in which a synopsis was altered. This is the only occasion of which I've read that Barks submitted a synopsis before drawing a story. If you can tell me more, please let me know.

Does the original art show traces of the title change? Or did Barks make the change in order of the editor?

CBL-notes: Lots of dialogue is censored. Any reference to dictator, rebel, civil war or revolution is changed to general, soldier, or war. Panel 2 of page 16 and panel 7 of page 21 are changed. In both, the garrotte Soy Bheen is about to strangle a rebel with, is removed.

On 29 July 1998, Gladstone art-director Gary Leach wrote about the censoring:

    A point or two about "Treasure of Marco Polo":

    The "cheap watches made by McDuck Enterprises" line was one we came up with to replace the "worker's paradise" reference, in order to make the story palatable to those at Disney charged with defending the "Disney Index" (presumably to the death). This, among other changes, rendered it approved for publication in the original Carl Barks Library.

    The story had been on the "Disney Index" for a number of years by the time the staff of Another Rainbow (original identity of what is now The Bruce Hamilton Company, current parent company of both Another Rainbow and Gladstone) began ramping up to produced the Barks Library. The lines referring to revolution and worker's paradise and the like had been part of the reason it had been banned, possibly due to the intense political sensitivities aroused in the U.S.A. by our recently, and badly, concluded "involvement" in Vietnam.

    The infamous "strangulation" scene: I don't know about anybody else, but I feel that Barks' editors were out to lunch when they let that through in the original publication. Or maybe they were just disarmed by all the James Bond/Man from UNCLE/Avengers tomfoolery running rampant in the Sixties (which, don't get me wrong, I loved!). Whatever the reason, the editorial standards of the day, had they been engaged in this instance, would almost certainly have caused that scene - or at least that wire - to be excised before the story saw print. I'm not saying we did what Western should have done, but I am implying it.

    Hmm...that didn't come off very humble, did it. Oh, well...

Animated adaption: Microducks From Outer Space

Backstage: In this story, cigars and especially the unhealthy smoke coming from them, have an important role in the story. Joe Cowles, who visited Carl Barks for the first time in the second half of October 1960, wrote in a August 2, 2000 e-mail: "Barks, who had been a smoker for many years, had foregone the habit by the time I knew him."

Research: On the Disney comics Mailing List there was a discussion on logical flaws in this story. Detailed information

Based on: king scrooge the first [pencil script]

Additional credits: Barks' list indicates that "King Scrooge the First" was written as a twenty-four page story; however, the story's dialogue in his pencil script is identical with that in the story as published, and covers only twenty-one pages." In a February 24, 1972 letter to Michael Barrier, Barks wrote: "This is a mystery to me, too, I got paid for 24 pages."

Investigation of scripts.

Surviving material: king scrooge the first [shooting script]

Remakes: In the late 1980s(?), Ulrich Schröder has worked on a redrawn version of the story, using Barks' style while following Strobl's art. Of this project, only an inked half page has been published. It visualizes the alternate final confrontation between Khan Khan and Scrooge, as Barks described it in king scrooge the first [shooting script].
The 3 or 4 original pages Schröder drew for the story got destroyed by a big fire in his home in Aachen, Germany. No copies of this art exist, but fortunately Schröder seems to have said in September 1997 that he had restarted working on the story and that he now intends to complete it (he draws comics only in his spare time).
In a December 21, 2000 e-mail to the Disney Comics Mailing List, Luca Boschi answered the question if Daan Jippes has redrawn the story: "NO. He shall not do it. Ulrich Schroder begun to do it, some years ago, but when his job was quite on, a big fire in his house, in Aachen, destroyed these and othe original artworks. Now he started to draw it again from the beginning, but he has a lot of work to do in Disney France and stopped it again his project (I don't know at which stage)..."

Trivia: Reference to death. The 4000-year-old Swami Khan Khan takes antidote to immortality powder. (page 21)

Congruences:

W US 16-02 in "Back to Long Ago!"
    Ducks imagining themselves being in another, earlier time. In "Back to Long Ago!" they "levitate persons back in mind" (panel 2.4), though during the story they start to believe they actually have been these persons (panels 6.8 and 8.5). In "King Scrooge the First" they are the "near-reincarnation" of their ancestors in the sense that they carry their genes (panels 2.4, 2.5, 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3).
