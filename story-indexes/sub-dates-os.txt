W OS 9-02 finds Pirate Gold

Barrier: MBAC-106
CBL: 01A-019
Type: story
Art: Carl Barks (pages 1,2,5,12-40), Jack Hannah (pages 3,4,6-11,41-64)
Plot: Harry Reeves, Homer Brightman
Script: Bob Karp
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: Date not available
Publication date: 1942
Issue: Donald Duck One Shot 9
Pages: 64

Additional credits: Rescripted from photostats of the storyboards for the abandoned animated movie Morgan's Ghost. The story adaption was written by Bob Karp.

Landmark: Barks's first comic book work (as artist). He illustrated 32 of the 64 pages: page 1, 2, 5, 12-40. The other pages were illustrated by Jack Hannah, at that time Barks's partner in the Duck unit of the story department at the Disney Studio.

Backstage: In a 1978 article, Barks said about this story: "'Pirate Gold' proved to the publishers that Donald didn't have to be in constant turmoil in order to be interesting. His bungling mistakes and his blissful innocence of danger and of being outrageously victimized proved just as amusing as his tantrums. He came off great in a sympathetic role, and his brattish little nephews came off equally great as the 'brains' of the family.

The comedy situation of Donald the reckless bungler getting into hopeless troubles from which he is extricated by his sharp-witted, suspicious-natured nephews was competently developed in this story, and it has carried on into many tales of high and not-so-high adventures ever since."

W OS 29-01 and the Mummy's Ring

Barrier: MBAC-106
CBL: 01A-161
Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1943, May 10
Publication date: 1943, (September)
Issue: Donald Duck One Shot 29
Pages: 28

Additional credits: In 1965, Barks was asked to re-ink page 1, page 16, and page 17 for the story's reprint in "Uncle Scrooge & Donald Duck" No. 1.

Status: The "sort of script" is lost.

Backstage:

    Barks has recalled submitting "a sort of script".
    Chuck Couch, who worked with Barks as a story man at the Disney studio, is caricatured on a wanted poster on panel 7 of page 7.

W OS 29-02 in "The Hard Loser"

So the joke's on me, eh?
-- Donald Duck

Barrier: MBAC-106
CBL: 01A-189
Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1943, May 10
Publication date: 1943, (September)
Issue: Donald Duck One Shot 29
Pages: 10

Landmark: Donald mentions "grandpa", who has an "old buggy horse" (1.4).

CBL-notes: Retouched, art looks muddy overall. After this set was printed, the original 1943 proof pages were discovered. For this reason, the version of the story in "Walt Disney Comics and Stories" No. 551 (1991) is far superior to the Carl Barks Library version (although the word "queer" in panel 1 of page 7 is changed into "weird").

Appearances: Screwball Derby (1.3); grandpa's old buggy horse (1.4); John the Junkman (2.5, 3.4); Hamilton (2.6).

Barrier: MBAC-106

Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1943, May 29
Publication date: 1943, (September)
Issue: Donald Duck One Shot 29
Pages: 26

Additional credits: In a June 9, 1968 letter to Michael Barrier, Barks wrote: "In the Sept. 1943 D.D. the story 'Too Many Pets' was a sort of collaboration. The script was started by a writer at the Disney Studio who found himself so overloaded with work on plots for the Mickey comic strips that he had to quit 'Too Many Pets.' I was handed the half-outlined plot and asked to do what I could with it. I merely polished up the other writer's gags and situations, and lengthened the tale, and lo! it didn't look too bad for that spy-conscious era. The Disney writer was named Merrill (something-or-other). He had been Walt Kelly's partner in a story unit at Disneys. I understand he got fed up with gag writing and bought a nursery (plants and trees) and lived happily ever after." (The artist's name is Merrill the Maris).

CBL-notes: Retouched, art looks muddy overall.

Inducks: Qus/QOS 48
Barrier: MBAC-130
Bear Book: BBB-013
Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: [unknown]
Hero: Porky Pig
Submission: 1944, March 21
Publication date: 1944, (July)
Issue: Porky Pig One Shot 48
Pages: 24

Landmark: Porky Pig story.

Changes: Looking carefully at the heads of Bugs Bunny, Petunia and Porky, occasionally small black lines can be seen where drawings were pasted over Barks' originals. In an August 21, 1974 letter, Barks wrote: "... a few of the Porky or Petunia faces may have been reworked by the staff artists in the editorial room. All of the Bugs heads had to be redrawn, which pleased me very much. I am sure that if my Bugs had been acceptable, the office would have added that series to my work load."

Status: Original version is lost.

Appearances: Porky Pig, Bugs Bunny, Petunia, Dauntless of the Mounties, Canada.

Backstage: In a June 9, 1966 letter to Michael Barrier, Barks wrote: "Mickey Mouse and Porky Pig I barely touched. They weren't my cup of tea."

In a February 20, 1970 letter to Barrier, Barks wrote: "About how I happened to do the Mickey and Porky series in 1944 and '45 - I was asked to do so by the office. I wouldn't have ventured into those characters' field by choice."

Barrier: MBAC-106
CBL: 01B-271
Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1944, August 9
Publication date: 1945, (January)
Issue: Donald Duck One Shot 62
Pages: 24

Cross-references: Donald is sick of snow and cold. The nephews suggest: "Let's go / down South / Unca' Donald!" (1.2) In the beginning of the next adventure in the same issue, «in Mystery of the Swamp», they are near the Everglades, Florida. Although this is not a cross-reference, it might be some sort of continuation of what happened after Donald and the nephews have finished flying supplies of penicillin to Alaska.

Barrier: MBAC-106
CBL: 01B-295
Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1944, September 23
Publication date: 1945, (January)
Issue: Donald Duck One Shot 62
Pages: 24

Surviving material:

running man with webbed feet ?
    detail of an early Gneezle?

Backstage: In 1976 and 1983 interviews, Barks has commented on how the Everglades became the inspiration of this story.
Stephen Eberhart's article "Somewhere Under the Rainbow (Part I)", published in The Barks Collector 21, identifies running man with webbed feet as a sketch of an early Gneezle. This design was used as detail for Student Witch. Detailed information

Research: The Everglades is an existant place. It's the maze of mangrove islands at the south-west tip of Florida, in the United States of America. Nowadays, the Everglades is nothing like the place depicted in this story anymore. Detailed information

Cross-references: Although there don't seem to be any cross-references, this story might be some sort of continuation of what happened in «in Frozen Gold», after Donald and the nephews have finished flying supplies of penicillin to Alaska, and Donald is now complaining about the lack of adventure.

Barrier: MBAC-125

Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Mickey Mouse
Submission: 1945, April 27
Publication date: 1945, (August)
Issue: Mickey Mouse One Shot 79
Pages: 11

Landmark: Mickey Mouse story.

Appearances: Whoosit, living at 72 Verbena Boulevard (6.5 and 6.7).

Backstage: In a September 18, 1970 letter to Donald Ault, Barks wrote: "Strange to say, I had completely forgotten the story. Reading it, I could see my drawing style in the artwork. My old pay vouchers prove that I did do the art, so I'll puff out my chest and brag that I did a pretty fair Mickey and Goofy." Detailed information

Research: Barks used Floyd Gottfredson / Merril de Maris' "Mickey Mouse in Love trouble" (Mickey Mouse dailies 14 April 1941 - 5 July 1941, reprinted in WDC 36 - 39) as study for "Riddle of the Red Hat".

Questions:

    Are there more stories which Barks used as study for "The Riddle of the Red Hat"?
    Does "Verbena Boulevard" refer to a real street name?

W OS 108-01 in "The Terror of the River!!"

Terror of the River

Barrier: MBAC-106
CBL: 01B-321
Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1946, January 25
Publication date: 1946
Issue: Donald Duck One Shot 108
Pages: 28

Changes: If The Carl Barks Library - Set I has printed the story as it first appeared, then Western has altered the lay-out of the first page. Possibly, they seemed to have needed room under the page and so they apparently reduced the page (keeping the ratio) and widened the panels with new art (most notably on the right side of the page) so that the first page would still use the horizontal width of the comic-page fully. Tier 1 and 4 have a larger height than tier 2 and 3, which could mean that some art has been cut from the panels during the process.

Status: If changed, the original version is lost.

Backstage: Barks, about how he tried to avoid censoring: "For 'The Terror of the River' I needed a villain that was a mean son of a gun. I felt that if I made him totally nutty, it would get by the editors a great deal more than if I made him murderous. I created a guy that didn't leave any bad taste in people's mouths, didn't cause children any nightmares afterward. I was not writing for the horror comics."

Interviews:

Questions: Is the original publication identical to the reprint in The Carl Barks Library - Set I?

W OS 108-02 in "The Firebug"

Barrier: MBAC-106
CBL: 01B-349
Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1945, July 19
Publication date: 1946
Issue: Donald Duck One Shot 108
Pages: 13

Additional credits: This story has pages with nine to eleven panels each; most have ten panels. According to Barks's voucher, he was paid for thirteen pages "plus 30 panels," which was evidently Western's method of paying him for drawing more than eight panels per page. The vouchers for a few other stories in this crowded format carry similar notations.

Layout: Pages have nine to eleven panels each; most have ten.

Changes: The last two panels of this story are not by Barks: "The editors objected to the last couple of panels of that story because I had Donald set fire to the judge's wastebasket. [It] accidently burned down the courthouse, and he wound up in jail. Western couldn't have a Disney character looking out from behind bars in the final panel of the story, so they changed the ending. They didn't usually redraw my art like that; the editors would often suggest that the artist do the changing himself. But these two panels would have been done by one of the staff artists, either Carl Buettner or Tom McKimson."

As redrawn, Donald awakens and discovers that his adventures as a firebug have all been a bad dream. The original ending has no doubt been destroyed.

Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1946, December 9
Publication date: 1947, (May)
Issue: Donald Duck One Shot 147
Pages: 30

Research: Donald, thinking of buying a model plane: "I can get one from the war surplus people for much less! The army had lots of them during the war!" (1.3) Nephews: "Unca Donald, there's a letter here for you!" / "From the" / "war surplus depot!" (1.6) Though it's not literally being said, this could be a reference to World War II.

As part of Volcano Valley's president's grumbling, a swastika can be seen. (18.5)

Donald's 313 car is described as "1920 Mixwell engine! '22 Dudge body! '23 Paclac axles! Wheels off a lawn mower!" (panel 5.5)
Those are all puns on American automobile names. "Dudge" refers to Dodge. "Paclac" is a gag-combo of PACkard and CadilLAC, the two competitors for the high-end car buyers back in the old days. "Mixwell" refers to Maxwell. (The last probably coming from the very popular Jack Benny radio program.)

W OS 159-01 and the Ghost of the Grotto

Barrier: MBAC-107

Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1947, April 15
Publication date: 1947, (August)
Issue: Donald Duck One Shot 159
Pages: 26

Backstage: In a 1974 interview with Michael Barrier, Barks said that this story was a rare example of a story that was conceived as ten pages for "Walt Disney's Comics" and grew into a longer story for "Donald Duck": "I can remember the first idea I had on that was just trying to figure out something Donald could do. I thought of him sailing boats and came up with a potential ten pages of gathering seaweed, and selling this kelp, which would give me a lot of gags with boats. Like I told you before, I think of a scene, I mean a locale, and think, 'Well, I feel in the mood to draw boats, and the ocean, and so on,' and that would cause me to start working on that particular type of story. As I developed more and more things with the story, I think it's quite possible that that 'Ghost of the Grotto' was brought in as a menace. There is so much in that, I couldn't have thought of it in a whole bucketful of writing at once. It had to come out one thing after another."

On the Disney comics Mailing List, François Willot wrote: "A very important change in Carl Barks' work was "Ghost of the Grotto". Geoffrey Blum said that this story is a landmark, though one could also say this for "Adventure Down Under", submitted by Barks before "Ghost of the Grotto"." ("Adventure Down Under" was submitted on 4 April 1947.)

Additional credits: The invisibility spray may have been inspired by a similar gimmick in «The Vanishing Private». Another possible influence could have been «The Haunted Castle», an unproduced cartoon from 1940 in which Mickey, Donald, and Goofy are menaced by an invisible, sword-wielding ghost in an old Scottish estate. (As far as known, Barks did not contribute to that cartoon.)

Trivia: Reference to death. One of the castle's walls contains the skeleton of Sir Quackly. (panel 5.8, 6.7)

Backstage: "mybibliotitle" contains a newspaper quality, black-and-white 1947 Hemet News photograph of Barks, posing at his drawing board, with the original art of page 5A. As the art seems to look finished or almost finished, this photo must have been taken shortly before the story's submission.

Barks, about how he tried to avoid censoring: "There was certainly a bit of the horror story in 'The Old Castle's Secret'. A skeleton walled up in an old castle - that's almost the E.C. comics tradition. But such things are interesting, and I managed to put it over without getting too morbid."

Research: Diamond Dick says: "With some chemical spray I stole from a foreign spy during the war!" (31.6) Though it's not literally being said, this could be a reference to World War II.

Uncle Scrooge's castle at Dismal Downs is an amalgam of historic architecture. The basic structure is that of Harlech Castle in Wales. To give the building a more antique air, Barks added turrets and battlements from Glamis and a tower of Cawdor, both Scottish castles which figure in the legend of MacBeth. Pictures of the "National Geographic Society" (the May 1946 and July 1947 issues) were used as source, they are reprinted in the The Carl Barks Library - Set I (page 1A-249).

Changes: In this story, Western objected to the accent Barks had given the Plain Awful people and so they (for example) replaced incorrect use of "d" with "th" in their dialogue. Apparently it's something Western was making a conscious effort to do at the time, although they didn't bother to do it some years later (there are some late-1950s Br'er Rabbit stories that use "d" for "th" again, but they're fairly few).

Most notable are panels 20.5 ("th" letters slant differently than surrounding words; presumably replacing "de"); 22.8 (balloon extended on right-hand side to rewrite "dere" as "theah", rather cramped); 23.6 and 23.8 ("that's" for "dat's", "theah" for "dere"; in pic 6, "evah" seems to be a substitution too, perhaps for "nevah" -- eliminating an ungrammatical double-negative); 29.1 (some words cramped by the relettering); and 29.3 (sound effect lettering obviously cramped in places where "th" replaced "d").

Status: Original version is lost.

Backstage: In a 1983 interview for "The Carl Barks Library", Barks answered a question about his National Geographic research and how he drew the large panel with the complex stonework that gave the Ducks their first glimpse of the hidden village of Plain Awful. Detailed information

Research: The songs "Dixie" (19.4) and "Carry Me Back to Old Virginny" (20.1) are existant songs. "Dixie" was published in 1859 and "Old Virginny" was published in 1878.
Detail: Later in the story, it is explained that the natives learned the song from professor Rhutt Betlah who visited the valley from 1863 to 1868, which means that (in real life) he couldn't have known about "Carry Me Back to Old Virginny".
"Carry Me Back to Old Virginny" is about a former slave who reminisces about the good old days back on the plantation before the US Civil War, when all his needs were met by his kindly master and mistress, and life was good. The sentimental attitude towards the days of slavery is nowadays considered politically incorrect, so there is talk of a re-write of this Virginia state song.

Changes: Barks originally drew the zombie of "Voodoo Hoodoo" with blank eyeballs. The editors at Western Publishing feared that the vacant eyes might frighten children and so they added pupils and half-closed lids.
In panel 1.4 and 20.8, the editors substituted "done for" for "dead". In panel 6.7, "dead" was left unchanged.

Surviving material: bombie the zombie [preliminary study]

Status: Original version is lost.

CBL-notes: The faces of the natives are changed and the sharpened teeth are removed. The native dialect is deleted. Bombie the Zombie's nose is changed and the ring in his nose is removed. In panel 1 of page 15, the dialogue referring to the ring moving as the correct answer to the quiz master's question is changed.
In panel 8 of page 22, the words "done for" are replaced with "dead". They were changed by the Western editor before the story's first publication. (More dialogue has been changed. Information on that will follow.)

Reconstructions: In The Carl Barks Library - Set II, the dialogue is changed back. Unfortunately, this reprint is censored.

Additional credits: Barks credits Dana Coty with the idea of this story.

Landmark: First appearance of Gladstone Gander in the "Donald Duck" series.

CBL-notes: In three panels, words may have been reordered in the sentences of an Eskimo's dialogue to become slightly more grammatical.

Question: Possibly, this is only the case in the Carl Barks Library in Color. Can someone check if it's in the b/w Carl Barks Library, too? Also, which dialogue has been changed?

Details: In panel 14.3, Donald's eyes are drawn like Gladstone's. (Apart from the beak, instead of being attached to it.)

Trivia: Discussable reference to death. The mad scientist and the ancient Itsa Faka people more or less die when they are "dehydrated". (page 22)

Backstage: In a June 9, 1966 letter to Michael Barrier, Barks said: "About my 'morgue' of reference material. I have four files full of clippings of every sort of subject and type of drawing. Also have many years of Nat'l. Geographics, and an Encyclopedia Brittanica. The rock of gibraltar picture in 'Ancient Persia' and the authentic-looking background props and frescoes are from Nat'l Geo. I simplify such material, naturally."

Pages: 28

Landmark: Last story with prominent human appearances.

Trivia: Discussable references to death. Sound of counter-counter-etc. spies shooting each other. (5.1) Operator Minus-X jumping out of the train running over a tall bridge. This is the most discussable reference in this story, because there seems to be water under the bridge. (10.1) Donaldo El Quacko prefers to jump out the window rather than being punished by his leader. (28.5)

Backstage: Most of the characters in this story are humans, rather than humanoid dogs. Barks had used human characters in other stories, but never so prominently as in this one, and Western's editors did not approve. Barks said about it in a May 30, 1971 interview by Michael Barrier: "As soon as I took 'Dangerous Disguise' in, and Carl Buettner took a look at it, he said, 'That doesn't go good, having real humans.' It takes the ducks out of their own world." (Carl Buettner was Western's art editor.) After this story, humans were rarely used again.

Backstage: The supporting characters are humanoid dogs. Barks said in a May 30, 1971 interview with Barrier that he would have preferred to have drawn them as real humans, but he was warned for using humans when he submitted "Dangerous Disguise" (OS 308) four months earlier.

Research: This story is set in that section of Southern California in which Barks himself lived at the time. Detailed information

Intended issue: Donald Duck One Shot 348
Intended publication date: 1951, September-October

Description: One-page gag (idea?) for "Donald Duck" Four Color No. 348, submitted on February 8, 1951. The issue contains three one-page gags, all illustrated by an artist other than Barks. It is impossible to identify any one of the gags as his.

Status: Disappeared, or unidentified.

Other Barks submissions on this date: Barks submitted no other work on this date.

Questions: Michael Barrier lists this entry as both "one-page gag" and "one-page gag idea". I guess he means the latter?

Changes: The nephews are not drawn by Carl Barks. Grandma Duck is identified as "Grandmaw Duck". It is unknown how the cover originally was drawn. Maybe there was no identification of the family members in Barks' version at all? (Just a wild guess.)

Reconstructions: The Carl Barks Library - Set VI uses Barks-drawn nephews taken from W WDC 131-00 skyrocket tied to leg. "Grandmaw" is changed in "grandma" to comply with Barks' spelling. The cover as originally published is shown in an article.

Questions: Do you have any ideas about the lettering of the names being or not being by Barks?

Backstage: Ten pages of this story were accepted on February 15, 1951, the remaining twenty-two pages on March 15, 1951. In a 1974 interview with Michael Barrier, Barks said about this: "I think what happened there was that they wanted some of the material early, and so I just sent them the ten pages I had drawn at that point."

Interviews:

    1974 interview by Michael Barrier

Discussions: On the Disney comics Mailing List, there was a discussion in about continuity in comics. Gary Leach said about the story's ending: "Think of how different that milestone event would have been had Barks let himself get hung up by the concluding moments of "Shacktown." I suppose, had he been continuity minded, he could have looked ahead and ended "Shacktown" differently, but would we have wanted him to do that?" (August 12, 1997)

Rich Morrissey replied: "Not at all hard to explain? If you'll recall, the crust over the quicksand was solid enough to keep all those tons of money from falling... it was just so delicately balanced that sending buckets down, as the kids suggested, might have broken it. Once the train had removed a ton or two, though, enough of the weight would've been removed so $crooge could send buckets down to recover the rest more quickly." (August 14, 1997)

Appearances: Beagle Boys / Beagle Boys Inc. / Beagle Boys, Inc. (3.5).

Backstage: As this story reveals, Scrooge is able to dive into a pile of hard metal without crowning himself. "I don't explain that trick because I don't understand it myself," says Barks. "Perhaps it has something to do with his character: often he can do things which other people can't. He can go out in the desert and smell the presence of gold; other prospectors would have to dig mountains of dirt before they could find any nuggets."

W OS 422-02 and the "The Gilded Man"

Imagine that! Mr. Garland Goosepimple didn't want a reward!
How confoundedly noble can a person get?

Submission: 1952, January 31

Pages: 32

Appearances: British Guiana, South America (1.1); Blue Centennial stamp, worth ten cents apiece (1.1); Belgian Prince Leopold stamp, worth four bucks apiece (1.1); Green Bermuda stamp, worth sixty cents (2.7); 1932 Kookabura stamp from Australia, worth thirty cents (2.8); stamp collector Philo T. Ellic, living at millionaire row "120 Swankmore Drive" (4.6); Sprigley (6.7); El Dorado, legendary gilded man (8.1); Sir Walter Raleigh, who made three expeditions up the Orinoco (8.3); Pedro (8.8); Maria (8.8); a stamp collector from Boston (9.4); Georgetown (9.6); the old riverman, whose father was the mail carrier from the river settlements to Georgetown in 1856 (10.4 12.1); Trader Corn, the oil man (10.7); 1856 One-cent Magenta stamp, worth more than fifty thousand dollars (1.5, 11.4); Mexico (17.1); his majesty (24.2); Dockside post office (24.5); Miss Susiebelle Swan, late distant relative of Gladstone Gander. In 1880 she left 60 Honker Street, Mudhen, Ohio, U.S.A., giving a forwarding address of 10 Quack Road, Webfoot, Oregon. In 1901 she floated away from Webfoot, said to forward her mail to 45 Mallard Avenue, Duckburg, Calisota (25.3, 25.7, 26.1, 27.2); Gizmo Tool and [...] factory, 45 Mallard Avenue, Duckburg, Calisota (26.5); San Francisco (29.5); Boston (29.8); St. Louis (30.2); Chicago (29.5)

Philo T. Ellic's erroneous names for Gladstone Gander: Mr. Garfield (5.7); Mr. Gallstone Ginkle (6.4); Mr. Gillfinkle (6.7); Mr. Garland Goosepimple (6.8); Mr. Goldbrick (29.5); Grindstone Gimmick (32.5)

Research: Barks tells of the gilded man being in British Guiana, which is thousands of miles from where he was supposed to have been in legend and in fact. This apparently was an error Barks must have made in reading the historical references to El Dorado (or Eldorado) which spoke of him being in "Guiana", so Barks assumed this was the modern Guiana, which is incorrect. The original Guiana was all of northeast South America from the Atlantic to the Andes.

The Gilded Man was the leader of a South American tribe of Chibcha Indians. The spaniards called this legendary figure "El Dorado". But they came to call the lost "city of gold" that the Gilded Man was supposed to have ruled "Eldorado", obviously after him, but as a different definition, in the form of a single word.

Appearances:

Glittering Goldie (aged, with bear)
    First publication does not show Glittering Goldie being young. (See changes.)

Research: The song "After the Ball" mentioned in panel 11.6, is an existing song. It was written by Charles K. Harris in 1892 and it became a very big hit in the same year. "Back to the Klondike" takes place later (1898?), but in those days popular songs lasted for years, so it easily could have been part of Goldie's repertoire long after it first became a hit.
In 1893, "After The Ball" was a cylinder hit again, being on the charts for 10 weeks starting April 23, 1893 and reaching #1; as recorded by George J. Gaskin and an apparent whistling version by John Yorrke was on the charts for three weeks starting July 8, 1893 reaching the #3 position.
The song was from the Broadway Musical "A Trip To Chinatown". This musical started playing on November 9, 1891 and is considered the first "long running" broadway musical; and the sheet music sold 5 million copies.
The lyrics have some resemblance with Scrooge's situation: An old man who never married is remembering a girl he could have married but never did. In the song it is because of a misunderstanding, but the stubbornness of the man is in a way the same as Scrooge's.

Additional credits: Barks notes on his list, "I can't find voucher for 5 page story of fish money in Uncle S.#2. The story and drawings are mine." He indicated that the story was accepted by Western sometime in September 1952-and the date was probably late in the month, after Western had rejected a total of five pages of "Back to the Klondike."

W OS 495-00 pirate jack-in-the-box

Barrier: MBAC-133
CBL: 03A-117
Type: cover
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Uncle Scrooge
Submission: 1953, March 6
Publication date: 1953, (September)
Issue: Uncle Scrooge One Shot 495
Pages: 1

Description: Scrooge, Donald and the nephews are frightened by a pirate jack-in-the-box popping out of a treasure chest.

Layout: Gag cover.

Changes: Significant differences with jack-in-the-box [inked cover preliminary] are the knife in the pirate head's mouth; Scrooge's looking frightened instead of surprised; and the decoration on the spring and around the head's neck.
If jack-in-the-box [inked cover preliminary] was a concept sketch Barks submitted to his editors, who would pick and choose and return the drawings with suggestions for revisions, then they evidently have asked Barks to tone down his concept.
In the cover art, there's no confrontation with a sharp, scary knife. The pirate head's mouth is empty and only shows its teeth, the ducks are only startled by surprise, and Scrooge is laughing. (This might suggest that Scrooge is responsible for the joke.) Without the dangerous knife, this is a much prettier scene for a Disney comic book cover.
Also, another objection could be that the scene in jack-in-the-box [inked cover preliminary] seems to hint at a pirate story while there's no such story in the issue.

Surviving material:

CR OS 495 jack-in-the-box [inked cover preliminary]

Backstage: jack-in-the-box [inked cover preliminary] is one of three works given to the family Robinson while Barks lived as a guest at their family ranch near Hemmett, Riverside California, in 1953.

Submission: 1953, February 26

Issue: Uncle Scrooge One Shot 495
Pages: 22
Animated adaption: Down and Out in Duckburg

Changes: Apparently, the word "horse-radish" has been lettered into the story by the editor.

Backstage: When Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times went to press in 1981, Carl Barks and Ed Summer discussed titles and agreed what would be listed in that book's SCrooge comics' chronology. Not all the stories had originally appeared with a title. Barks even offered two alternate titles for this story: "Trouble From Long Ago" and "The Month of the Golden Goose."

In [1961], collector Malcolm Willits asked Barks for essentially the same information. In a January 17, 1962 letter to Willits, Barks suggested some off-the-cuff titles. The one he gave to this story was "Trouble From the Deep".

Congruences:

Hero: Gyro Gearloose
Submission: 1960, October 12
Publication date: 1961, May-July
Issue: Gyro Gearloose One Shot 1184
Pages: 5

Changes: Possibly, at least one page was cut from this story.

Some material may have been deleted in the vicinity of page 2. The Little Helper only is shown in the last three panels of the story as published. In panel 5.6, the Helper's attitude seems to underscore Donald's comments "Well, new ideas sometimes take a while to catch on!" In panel 5.7, Donald credits the Helper for thinking of the "novel headgear", adding "Then, too, Gyro, you and I weren't built right to properly introduce the game!" This raises the question if the story may have contained scenes or further explanations on what the Helper actually did. As published, the story doesn't contain any explanation nor scenes in which the Helper is shown suggesting the idea. There's also no hint how the Helper suggested the idea. This may have been a story point which was deleted from the story as published. As the Helper isn't "built right" to show Donald his ideas, his small posture also may have been a deleted story point at which Donald's comment in panel 5.7 seems to be referring.

Submission: 1961, April 8
Publication date: 1961, October-December ([September] 1961)
Issue: Donald Duck Album One Shot 1239 (Dell)
Pages: 1

Changes: Changed by the editor. Gyro Gearloose was included behind the hearth, in between Scrooge's and Grandma's heads, but has been removed. Brickwork of hearth has been redrawn, simplifying the more detailed brickwork as drawn by Barks. The walls of the hearth (behind Scrooge's legs) have been blacked in. All touches of shadow, most noticeably the shadow above Scrooge's legs, have been removed. Of Scrooge's hat, the highlights have been removed.

Details: Donald's jacket lacks the standard two buttons.
