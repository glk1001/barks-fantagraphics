Additional credits: Barks has recalled that the script for that first Donald story - in which Donald defends his Victory Garden from Crows - was sent to him by Western, which was then dealing with its artists under the name of one of its subsidiaries, Whitman, while publishing Walt Disney's Comics through another affiliate, K.K. Publications. Detailed information

Research: Donald says: "We'll make our own Victory Garden, boys!" (1.1). In a Januari 31, 2001 e-mail to the Disney Comics Mailing List, Don Rosa explained the relation between a victory garden and wartime: "a Victory Garden is what we Americans grew in the backyard during WWII to do our part in the Home Front economy."

Landmark: The first Donald Duck story both written and drawn by Barks.

Research: In Donald's imaginary newspaper "Daily Quack" (7.6) contains headlines like "Hophead elected police chief", and "No more gas says OPA". The "hophead" possibly is a 1940s slang term for someone who uses marijuana (an ancestor of "pothead"). The "OPA" headline is a wartime (WWII) reference to the Office of Price Administration, the temporary federal agency charged with controlling prices and running the rationing system. Gasoline was among the materials rationed by OPA.

Layout: Three tiers per page

Changes: Western found that Barks made the lady duck too buxom. "I had to spend more hours in the publisher's office flattening out all those bosoms," he once recalled. In panel 10.6, in which the kissing lady holds Donald against her, the change can obviously be seen because of the gap between Donald and the lady.

Status: Original version is lost.

Research: In panel 1.2, Donald complains "doggone such a life!" "Doggone it" is and has been for many years a common slang expression -- a mild exclamation, equal to "darn it" -- which is a non-profane way to say "Damn it." It is not considered cursing, and saying "doggone it" to native English speakers now would indicate that you are VERY outdated in American slang -- or that you have watched a lot of Westerns. (John Wayne and other cowboy heroes have been known to say "doggone it.")

    Pages 2 to 10 have an identical strip of art at the top, with "Donald Duck" lettered into it. This strip of art looks the same as in W WDC 34-01 good deeds and fire sticks.

Research: The wrangler of the ranch comments about his remaining horses: "They're the best we have, podner, the army drafted all our mounts under 28 years of age!" (1.4). This is a reference to World War II.

Donald, being thirsty, longs for "root beer" (6.4) and "Lemonade, limeade, ginger beer, root ale, malted soda... Coca pop!..." (7.1) Despite the use of the words "beer" and "ale", these drinks are not alcoholic. In an April 4, 2001 e-mail to the Disney Comics Mailing List, David Gerstein explained: "Root beer and ginger ale are typical American sodas, and I think Donald is supposed to be getting the names confused (though it doesn't work very well, as ginger beer is another word for ginger ale). A malted soda is a malted *ice cream* soda, an American soda fountain drink. Coca pop is now outdated slang for Coca-Cola type drinks."
On the same day, same list, Vic Pratt replied that ginger beer is "a popular drink here in England...actually, it is quite different to ginger ale, which is more specifically a mixer drink...ginger beer is usually imbibed on its own...once upon a time, I believe, it had a small amount of alcohol in it, when it was home-made..."

Questions: Could this be the first time that the nephews use their knowlegde of natural phenomena, like they would regularly do in later stories? In panel 4.7 they know that they're going further away from the ranch instead of getting closer to it: "When we left the ranch, the sun was on our right shoulder!" / "It is three hours higher now, and hitting the back of our necks!" / "We're goin' AWAY from the ranch!"

Landmark: First appearance of the "classic" neighbor Mr.Jones.

Research: In panel 7.6, Donald orders his nephews: "Get me one of those firecrackers you're savin' for the fourth - the biggest one you have!" The "fourth" is a reference to the American "4th of July", where the tradition is to spend the whole evening setting off firecrackers.

Questions: Could the saving of firecrackers be a reference to World War II?

Submission: 1943, October 20
Publication date: 1944, March
Issue: Walt Disney Comics & Stories 42, Vol. 4, No. 6
Pages: 7

Layout: Three tiers per page (as originally drawn).

Changes: This story was written and drawn as a ten-page story with three-tier pages, but published as a seven-pager. It was cut up, panels were trimmed or expanded and the panels were pasted up in eight- or ten-panel (four-tier) pages instead of the original six-panel (three-tier) pages. In some panels, drawings not by Barks were added to fill in the empty space caused by the alterations in his panels. Apparently, no panels were omitted. Detailed information

Status: Original version is lost.

CBL-notes: The bottom half of page 6 is redrawn.
In "The Carl Barks Library of Walt Disney's Comics and Stories in Color No. 3" a reconstruction of the story's original layout is used, unfortunately also with the redrawn art.

Reconstructions: The comic "Mickey and Donald" No. 15 (1989) published an attempt in converting "Kite Weather" into a ten-pager again. Unfortunately, one reconstructed page used redrawn art as a source.

Questions: Could this story also have contained a strip of art on top of pages 2 to 10, before it was changed into a four-tier seven-pager?

    First appearance of Bolivar in a Barks story.
    First appearance of Herbert.

Research: Donald holds a box of "pre-war Bon-bons" (3.5). This is a reference to World War II.

Questions: Could this story be the first one in which Donald and the nephews have an adult-kid rivalry? In this story the nephews intentionally annoy "parent" Donald by not following his order to go bathing. In earlier stories like W OS 29-02 in "The Hard Loser", W WDC 40-01 in Snow Fun, and W WDC 41-01 The Duck in the Iron Pants, there's also rivalry between Donald and the nephews, but in these stories Donald acts more like a "fourth nephew" than an adult. Even more because Donald is the cause of the rivalry in these stories. (The nephews only react to the tricks Donald has played on them.)

Landmark: Barks' first story showing a close-up of the moon. Donald's rocket ship travels around the moon. In panel 9.6, Donald says: "If people could see this view of the moon, they wouldn't sing songs about it!"

In comparison with real life, Donald's mid-1940s view of the moon is far ahead of its time. In 1959, the Soviet Union's Luna 3 spacecraft returned the first images of the far side of the Earth's moon. After six failed attempts, the Americans finally got their first close-up images of the moon five years later with the successful flight of Ranger 7.

Research: The formulae floating above Donald's head, in panel 1.7, mentions "OPA". This refers to World War II. "OPA" stands for the Office of Price Administration, the temporary federal agency charged with controlling prices and running the rationing system.
Donald decides: "I'm going to test Duckmite as a substitute for gasoline!" (5.4) Gasoline was among the materials rationed by OPA.
Before Donald goes to the moon, he says to the nephews: "Save my ration points so I can have a steak when I come back!" (7.10) Research: It seems Donald's reference to CH2, in panel 2.1, was years ahead of its time: the existence of this elusive chemical intermediate had not been proven in 1944. Detailed information

Research: In an August 2, 2000 e-mail, Joseph Cowles wrote about Barks' own interest in photography:

    "Barks enjoyed photography a great deal, was excellent at it back when it took a great deal more capability to obtain good photographs than it does today. He took copious amounts of 35MM color slides. These he used as reference for many of his drawings, which enabled him to illustrate local haciendas, bridges, mountain ranges, trees, roadways and many other things with accuracy.

    Some scenes [my wife] Barb and I have recognized from time to time, on our drives around the southland. I bet you that somewhere Barks has a cache of every photo he ever took - numbered, dated and described. Now that's a whole new area for fans to explore: the relationship to Barks' photos and his cartoon panels. And it would be an historical adventure, too, showing what southern California looked like back in the halcyon days of the 40's and 50's."

In a July 29, 2000 e-mail, Joseph Cowles wrote:

    "I do not have photos of me with Carl Barks, although surely there must have been some taken on one of my visits with him and GarÃ©. The one signed photo I have of Barks is accompanied by a letter telling about his new camera and how he took the picture."

Pages: 10

Landmark: As far as known, the only published 1940s story of which some original art has survived.

Surviving material: Original art of page 4. It survived because a very eager Donald Duck strip reader wrote to Dell Publishing in 1940s and asked for any original Donald Duck strip. The point was that he had read newspaper strips, which were drawn by Al Taliaferro. Later these two half pages were sold and resold as Taliaferro's art, until someone noticed the real artist. On the bottom half-page there is one correction. Barks has at first drawn stitches on the live rat and corrected them on the toy rat (in panel 4.6).

Backstage: Donald ends up in jail in the last panel. (10.8) When Barks did the same in "The Firebug" (OS 108-02), submitted less than a month later, on July 19, 1945, the editor decided to turn the end of that story, into Donald waking up from a dream.

Cross-references: The nephews are bathing in pile of cash, and Donald comments: "The kids are rolling in money since they got that five hundred dollars reward for catching the bank bandit last month!" (1.1) This is a cross-reference to what happened in the previous monthly, in Â«thug busters inc.Â».

Questions: Donald ends up in a brick building with metal bars on the window. It looks like a jail or prison. A sign in front says "durance vile" (old fashioned English form of unpleasant endurance - meaning imprisonment or confinement). Is this a phrase formerly (or currently) used by judges in USA or The British Commonwealth of Nations in sentencing defendents found guilty?

Changes: In an April 1968 letter to Michael Barrier, Barks said the ducks' halos in the last panel were added by an editor.

Status: Since the halos seem to have been added in empty parts of the panel, apparently no art was damaged.

CBL-notes: (R) In the last panel of this story, the halos added by the Western editors are removed. Panel as printed by Western is not shown.

Reconstructions: In "The Carl Barks Library - Set VII" the halos are removed.

Trivia: Donald's address is mentioned as "Oak Street" (10.9).

Backstage: In a 1945 cartoon titled Â«Cured DuckÂ», Daisy demands that Donald controls his hot temper, but finally reveals herself to be just as volatile. Barks's story builds on the same idea. According to Tom Andrae, in the Carl Barks Library, it may well have been sparked by that cartoon.

Research: The nephews' say that Donald has forty pounds of sugar hidden in the garage. (6.3) This could be a reference to World War II, to rationing and hoarding.

Details: Panel 2.4 spells "smugsnorkle squatty". Panels 2.5 and 2.7 spell "smugsnorkle squattie". Panels 3.1 and 3.2 spell "squattie"

Questions: Is the reprint in "The Carl Barks Library" (except for the four redrawn panels) identical to the reprint in "Walt Disney's Comics & Stories" No. 305, 1966?
Also, in panel 10.7 the second balloon has an odd shape, as if the balloon was enlarged to fit the word "substitutes" into it. Is this also the case in the original comic?

Appearances: Thanksgiving [Day] (1.2); Potto Gas (1.3); Finnegan's Hall (A.D. 1906, "Hocus plus pocus", location of raffle at ten o'clock A.M., tickets $1.00, prize is a turkey, 1.6, 2.4 and 2.5); 236037 (number on the raffle ticket, 2.1); Barks Dog Soup (4.2); Raffles (name for the male turkey won by the nephews, 4.3); Oolated Squiggs (4.4); Acme Swofs (4.4); Texas (5.3); Watson (5.3); Southside Park (5.4); Southside Good Joes' Turkey Shoot (turkey shoot in Soutside Park, with a mortgage on the hall, three bullseyes out of five win a bird, 5.5 and 6.6); creek in Southside Park (5.6); San Pedro (5.8); Buffalo Bill (6.1); golf course near Southside Park (6.2).

Backstage: On panel 4.2, a can of "Barks Dog Soup" is shown in Donald's kitchen-cupboard. In a May 17, 1981, letter to Barrier, Barks wrote: "As for the can of dog food with Barks on it..., I probably put the name on it myself just to see if the editors would white it out." This is the only Barks story in which his name appears.

Joseph Cowles wrote in a August 2, 2000 e-mail:

    "[GarÃ©] said that Carl was always disappointed that he couldn't sign his art, and from time to time would try to sneak in his signature or some other means of identifying his work, but that the editors at Western usually discovered and removed it.

    (Fans certainly didn't have any difficulty identifying "The Good Artist," but it does give one a glimpse of Barks' underlying insecurity in those days. At some level, he really did consider himself to be "a failed chicken farmer." He told me that he was longing for the day when he could retire from the grinding deadline pressures of cartooning, and thought he might be happiest opening up a little cabinet shop where he could work with his hands to create things from wood.)"

Only two issues later, on the cover of "Walt Disney Comics and Stories" No. 78, Barks name was mentioned by Walt Kelly (or Carl Buettner?). On the cover of this issue a box is labeled "Bark's [sic] Jiffy Chicken Dinner" - a reference to Barks' 1940s chicken farm at San Jacinto, California.

Research: In panel 1.7, Huey says: "The blue streak you see next will be Huey Duck on his way to a raffle!" At first glance, foreign readers might mistake this as a hint of what colour Huey's cap could be. (As happened on this site.)
In an August 1, 2006 email to the Disney Comics Mailing List, Dan Shane corrected: "Blue streak" is an American idiom that signifies anything moving at such high speed to essentially appear as a blur, so it would not matter what color clothing the individual was wearing. He would never be considered a streak of any color but blue."

Updates: In panel 3.7, the nephews sing "Jingle Bells", which is an existant Christmas song.

Questions: In "The Carl Barks Library - Set VII" a thin line appears on the can with Acme Swofs (4.4), as if one of either words could have been added later. Is this also the case in the original comic?

Research: At the end of this story there's a silhoutte of Donald chasing the cat just crossing a county border, which can be seen by a sign saying "ENTERING SQUASH COUNTY - DON'T PICKA DA PUNK!" This is a gag of which even some modern-day Americans may now have major trouble understanding it. Detailed information

Research: Just before he attacks a big man at a bus stop, Donald says: "I'll give him the flying arm-lock that I learned in commando school!" (7.7) As a result, the big man is running away, and yelling: "What ran into me - A Tiger tank?" (8.1) As this story was made in 1947, it's likely that "Tiger tank" means the infamous World War II German Tiger tank. (Maybe a hidden joke could be that the big man Donald beat up was a war veteran?)

Congruences: Donald tries to carve a "turkey" meal with a knife. The "turkey" is too tough, so Donald uses a mincer. (9.6 to 10.3) This scene is more or less similar to Al Taliaferro's December 26, 1938 Donald Duck daily strip. (Donald tries to carve a turkey meal with a knife. The turkey is too slippery, so Donald uses a vice.)

Updates: Stuck on the moon, which in this story must have an air atmosphere, the ducks accidently drink from a "natural rocket fluid" spring containing "kerosine", "oil of gun cotton" and "essence of nitro-glycerine" (8.7). At that point, Donald has just scared away a moonman with a burning match (8.4), about which he comments: "No wonder that guy was afraid of fire!" (8.8)

The documentary "95 Worlds and Counting", premiered on Discovery Channel in February 2001, mentions it can rain fuel (methane?) on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. And if there would be air, one could cause an enormous explosion with a lighter.

Research: On the Disney comics Mailing List, Dwight Decker gave an answer to the question if Mexican jumping beans really jump: "Yes, they do! They're seeds of a Mexican plant with an insect larva inside. The movement of the larva inside causes the seed to seem to jump. The movement is real, and even startling, though exaggerated in cartoons."

Research: Big game hunter Frank Buck, upon whom "Frank Bucko" on page 2 was obviously based, was a popular real life adventurer of the day. His exploits were chronicled often in that era's journals and were even the subject of a short-lived comic book series, "Frank Buck", published by Fox Features in 1950. More recently, the Frank Buck legend enjoyed a brief resurgence in the form of 1982/83 television adventure series, "Bring 'Em Back Alive."

Additional credits: In his 1969 list of work for Western, Barks wrote about this story: "Script came from the office. I was paid $ 25 extra for 'revising' it."

Landmark: Mickey Mouse is mentioned in panel 5.7. Barks seldom used Disney characters outside the Duck Family in any of his stories. When asked to comment for the Library about this reference, he wrote, "I can't remember the origin of the 'Mickey's Social Security number' gag. It probably was in the script as it came from the office. I doubt that I would have felt it permissible to mention Mickey."

In Barbara Boatner's Introduction to The Fine Art of Walt Disney's Donald Duck (page 24), Barks commented on Western Publishing's policy of keeping the identities separate of the traditional Disney characters whenever practical because of the many titles using the different names, saying "I wouldn't have been tempted to use them, anyway."

Research: The radio-quiz show Donald appears on was based on the then popular games series, "Truth or Consequences." This show entertained audiences by demeaning its contestants, forcing them to take the consequences if they failed to answer questions correctly. The results could be cruel, and Barks made Donald's humiliation positively brutal to satirize the sadism of basing a show on such a concept.

Panel 1.1 states that "Caesar was born in 102 B.C.!" Actually there have been different opinions about this date. The introduction to a 1897 edition of Caesar's Gallic Wars mentions that "Gaius Iulius Caesar was born July 12, in the year 100 before Christ [Some scholars put the date two years earlier. Cf. Mommsen, "History of Rome," (ed. of 1895), vol. iv., pp. 278-280.], being thus six years younger than Cicero and Pompey."

Congruences:

Additional credits: The school turns out to be closed because it is Saturday. This scene is similar to an alternate, unproduced conclusion for the animated cartoon Truant Officer Donald. In contrary to the cartoon, Barks allowed Donald to triumph over the nephews. Truant officer Donald opens the schoolhouse and makes the boys write "Crime does not pay" one hundred times on the blackboard. About this, Tom Andrae wrote in the Carl Barks Library: "In books which children could read and reread, open rebellion was not as permissible as in a cartoon that would flash by quickly on the screen."

    In this 1947 two-pager, Donald takes a hike into the great outdoors to soothe his "mangled" nerves, but instead he must contend with wild creatures, a fall from a cliff, and an avalanche. The story ends with Donald joining the nephews at a "blood and thunder" western movie, only to fall peacefully asleep during the on-screen's heaviest point blank gunplay.

Appearances: Jeebs (Scrooge's secretary, 3.5); Squeezem, Fleecem, Skinem, and Skip (fake law firm, 3.7); Marmaduke Mallard (fake late uncle, 3.8); painter working on "Man Of Ze Sub-Order" (4.6); Lassie O'Doon (Scrooge yaught, 9.1).

Research: In panel 1.4, a nephew sings "Yo ho! And a bottle of rhubarb juice!". This is a reference to an existant old English sailor song, ""Yo ho, and a bottle of rum".

The same idea Barks developed for Donald to use in raising Scrooge's ship in this issue's story was devised by Danish engineer Karl KrÃ¸yer in 1964. His attempt to patent the process proved unsuccessful because the Patent Office ruled a "preliminary description" of the invention had already been published. Detailed information

Pages: 10

Appearances: Thrushwhistle Glen (park, panel 1.4); Siberian Crufflecrow (bird, panel 5.4); Red Ant Hollow (location of picnic, panel 8.7); Nature Boys (panel 9.1).

Research: The Nature Boys club, whom Donald adressed in this story, is no doubt a jab by Barks at the "nature boy" movement at the time. The Nature Boys were that period's version of the beatniks and hippies: long haired and bearded inviduals who eschewed the modern world and preferred instead to live "closer to nature."

Questions: In panel 7.7, a "big bomb" is mentioned. The bold lettering of "big" seems to look different from the rest of the lettering. Does it sound likely that there has originally been another word, which was replaced by the editors? (Something like "atom bomb", for example?)

Research: Desert Hot Springs, in panel 9.5, is a community of hot mineral water spas which was a popular hideaway for strung-out movie stars and other Hollywood types in the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's.

El Rancho Swanko Super Desert Hot Springs Hotel and Health Resort, panel 9.5 About this location, Joseph Cowles wrote in a August 2, 2000 e-mail:

"The Barkses lived on the opposite side of the [San Jacinto mountains], in Hemet during the times I visited them, and in the town of San Jacinto after that. Upon his retirement they moved around quite a bit, trying out beach life in Laguna, before working their way up the coast to the rather high-ticket community of Goleta. But in the years that they lived out this way, Barks developed an affection for the desert, creating a number of stories which used this environment as a venue.

One of these desert-scene stories appeared in WDC&S for October 1949, which means that Barks probably created it that spring (he worked about six months in advance of publication), possibly after spending a long weekend soaking up the sun and basking in our fresh natural mineral waters (which, however, do not smell of sulphur). Attached is a panel I gleaned from the "Carl Barks Library", and colorized. While it doesn't depict a particular spa that is presently standing, it certainly shows the architecture hereabouts, especially as it might have been a half century ago, with the thick adobe-style stuccoed walls and red Spanish tiles."

Very few kids ever get to summer camp, but all can dream of the woodsy adventures they would have in such a place. I felt the ducks could find plenty to do at far-out Camp Whaha-Go-Gaga. Bears, of course, are necessary 'heavies' in most woodsy adventures".

Landmark: With this story, the apostrophe that had appeared after "Unca" whenever the nephews spoke to or about Donald was dropped. In 1983 notes for "The Carl Barks Library", Barks wrote: "I dropped the apostrophe because I was beginning to feel it was redundant. The word Unca had become part of the language." Western Publishing's editors observed this, or at least there must have been some communication on the subject, because non-Barks duck stories drawn at the same time also dropped the apostrophe.
Interestingly, Floyd Gottfredson never used anything but "Unca" - without the apostrophe - from the early 1930s when he had Mickey Mouse's nephews use the form.

Barks didn't use the apostrophe in all the preceding stories. From W WDC 31-05 victory garden up to W WDC 38-02 in "Good Neighbors", no apostrophe was used. W WDC 39-01 in Salesman Donald is the first WDC-story in which the apostrophe appears. From W WDC 41-01 The Duck in the Iron Pants up to W WDC 46-02 in "Camera Crazy", the apostrophe again is dropped. In W WDC 47-02 falcon farragut, the apostrophe reappears.

Appearances: Rockies (mentioned by Donald, 1.5); Noble X. Ample of the Secret Service (panel 6.7); village of Codfish Cove (9.7).

Landmark: First appearance of the Beagle Boys / Beagle Boys Inc. / Beagle Boys, Inc..
Scrooge refers to his safe as "money bin".

Research: Panel 4.3 mentions the Boer War. There were actually a few Boer Wars: wars in Southern Africa between the Boers (colonists of Dutch descent) and the English colonial power. Maybe the Boer War was in 1902. In one Dutch translation "de Boerenoorlog van 1902" is mentioned. The Dutch probably added "1902" because they (rightfully) thought that a Dutch child wouldn't know when the Boer War was...

Questions: Maybe the barrel from Queen Victoria's Royal Artillery (also shown on page 4) gives a clue which Boer War is meant?

W WDC 137-02 the screaming cowboy

Oh, bury me thar
with my battered git-tar
a-screamin' my heart out fer yew!
-- Donald Duck

Barrier: MBAC-174
CBL: 08B-395
Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1951, June 21
Publication date: 1952, February
Issue: Walt Disney Comics & Stories 137, Vol. 12, No. 5
Pages: 10

Description: Donald has been writing songs for three weeks until he succeeds by selling one of them, "The Screaming Cowboy". He celebrates it by taking the nephews to a ritzy winter resort in Avalance Valley. In the resort, he discovers a juke box with a record of the song.

Appearances: Soso Mountains (1.3); "The Screaming Cowboy" (song, 1.4); Avalance Valley (1.6); Junior Woodchuck (6.2); The Snow Hermit (8.4).

Trivia: The nephews' Junior Woodchucks rank is identified as "ten star generals" (6.2).

Research:

    There has probably been no time in post-World War II history that the cowboy has enjoyed more media popularity than during the early 1950s. In this story songwriter Donald has obviously capitalized on the craze with "The Screaming Cowboy".
    In the late 1920s or early 1930s (certainly no later than the mid 1930s), there was a country and western novelty record which contained a parody of both the typical and popular "sad" and "happy" cowboy songs of the period.
    According to panels 2.5 and 7.3, the song was recorded with a "jug band". Listen to a mp3-excerpt of The Leasebreakers playing "Jug Band Duet" to hear an example of jug band music.

Detailed information

Updates: Goofy has been another "screaming cowboy" in "Goofy the Kid-- The moaning cowboy!", a story by Bill Walsh & Floyd Gottfredson (August 12 - August 24, 1946). Two lines from his songs are: "Daown in Taixas..." (August 20) and "...on thuh range..." (August 23).
In another story by Bill Walsh & Floyd Gottfredson, Mickey writes a song with dire consequences -- people literally go mad about it: "Bull-a-griddle- Fid-a-griddle-DEE!" (July 28 - August 9, 1947).

Pages: 10

Landmark: First appearance of a Cornelius Coot statue.

Backstage: In 1983 notes written for "The Carl Barks Library", Barks commented: "I used cartoonist's license to carry this statue-building contest to the ridiculous limits of nonsense. How will the world ever get along without Maharajah's?"

One reader found the town so real that she took umbrage at its endorsement of the money contest and wrote Western Publishing a complaint. "I don't blame that woman," Barks has said in an interview with Donald Ault and Thomas Andrae on 4 August 1975, "for writing a letter saying that she thought it was a gross misuse of money to build these enormous statues all crusted with diamonds when there were so many things that could have been done with that money, like building hospitals and schools and better jails."
"I wrote back to the office telling them that the woman missed the point entirely. The money that had been spent on those statues had bought labor and materials and had all gone into circulation, much better than if it had continued lying in the Maharadjah's money bin or Uncle Scrooge's money bin. It had created a tremendous amount of work, for jewelers and goldsmiths and concrete men and hydraulics experts. Everybody had a job out of that, so the money hadn't been wasted at all."

Additional credits: The artwork for this cover is entered under both of the above dates on Barks's list, and its contents is described in both instances. It is possible that the earlier entry is for the idea, and the later entry for the artwork, or that one of the entries is for another cover entirely.

See also additional credits under entries for WDC 137-00, WDC 137-00, and WDC 142-00.

Changes: Barks' original concept for this cover had Donald literally "seeing red". An editor at Western must have disliked this idea, however, and had a staff artist blacken in the Duck's pupils.

Reconstructions: In The Carl Barks Library - Set VIII, Barks's original intention is reconstructed.

Backstage: Barks has commented that on this cover, Scrooge was added as an afterthought because of the incredibly escalating popularity of the character at the time (the first issue of Uncle Scrooge appeared on the stands just a few months earlier, in March of 1952).

Changes: Apparently, this cover was changed by the editor. Water spurting against Donald's beak may have been removed; the solid black of his coat may have been removed; and his bowtie may have been added. If so, a reason could be that this was done to make Donald more recognizable as cover character.

David Gerstein in a May 14, 2001 e-mail: "I think we're really seeing two different inking jobs! Not only is the water on Donald's beak removed, but the drops forming the splashes are differently placed on the two covers, and the tree has different marks on its trunk from one version of the cover to the other.
While almost every other detail about the covers is the same, the texture of various lines differs, again suggesting that there are two legitimate Barks inks of this cover, but if so... why? And how?"

Status: The bowtie-less, solid black coat version has been published as front cover for the Danish comic "Anders And & Co." No. 3, 1953.

Updates: Larger scan of the art as on "Anders And & Co." No. 3 of 1953. (Circa 225Kb.)

Questions: How come that a different version was used in Europe? What was the relation between Western Publishing and Europe at that time?

Research: The philosophy of the "Flipism" in this story is the subject of a full-length novel by Luke Rhinehart, "The Dice Man" (1971). It is about a man who - as Donald Duck had done twenty years earlier - chooses to live his life by the flip of a coin.

Notes: More information can be found in a "Lost in the Andes" article in The Carl Barks Library (set 1).

Backstage: In 1983 notes for The Carl Barks Library, Barks commented that the inspiration "grew out of the news events of the period. Rainmaking by seeding clouds was getting a lot of publicity, and who could perfect the technique better than Donald Duck - and overdo it more disastrously?"

Changes: Possibly, Donald's eyes are changed. A theory could be that Donald originally had a frown because of seeing something suspicious, which was changed by the editor who might have felt that Donald's look was too negative for a comic book cover. The cover truant officer and state line also contains Donald having a frowned look, but there the nephews' smiles smooth over Donald's negativity.

Status: If changed, no original version is known to exist.

Changes: WDC 157, alternate panel In an October 3, 1973 letter (to Kim Weston?), Barks says that this "was quite likely changed to a dream ending by me. I believe I recall looking at the panel of Uncle Scrooge's money ramp and deciding it looked too IMPOSSIBLE to be real".

Surviving material:

    CX WDC 157 stairway of money [surviving cut material]
    Alternate panel. A gloating Scrooge pursues an irritated Donald.
    Caption: "So, from henceforth on -- every day!"
    Scrooge: "WELL? When are you going to think of something else you can beat me at?"
    The shape of this panel implies that it originally was on the place of published panel 10.7.

Status: No other cut art is known to exist. As published panels 10.6 and 10.8 also show Donald being awoken, these must have replaced alternate panels as well.

Appearances: Old Demon Tooth (mountain, 3.2).

Correspondence:

Changes: Western had a staff artist alter the art on Donald's face. According to "The Carl Barks Library - Set VIII" (page 8C-634), the reason probably was to make him look sicker than he must have looked in Barks's original. (See the "questions"-field, for some comments on this.)

Status: Original version is lost.

Questions: Maybe Donald's face was changed too make him look LESS sick? Reason for this could be that Barks changed Donald's face too much by making him look sick, which made him less recognizable as cover character. As his sailor suit and cap are not shown, Donald's face is the only way to identify him as being Donald.

Additional credits: In a January 8, 1983 interview, GarÃ© Barks recalled that she came up with her "one gag" for a Donald Duck story while her husband was scripting this "ten pager". The nephews have just astonished Donald with a live camel they bought from a defunct circus for him as a gift. Donald hesitatingly asks if it didn't cost them a lot of money. GarÃ©'s gag is the nephews' answer in the next panel, saying: "Only FIFTY CENTS! If we'd had two dollars, we could have bought an ELEPHANT!" (2.4).

GarÃ© Barks also was an artist and she helped with the lettering of the duck stories from the early 1950s, did extensive gagwriting for Dahl Mikkelsen's syndicated pantomime comic strip Ferd'nand.

Details: One of the rare instances where Barks neglected to give the Ducks pie-cut eyes. The pie cuts were classically the last thing Barks did to his originals, so it appears that in this case he simply forgot to do this final step before mailing the cover off to Western. Barks later re-did his cover as an oil painting entitled as "The Compleat Golfer" (with pie-cut eyes). It is reproduced in "The Fine Art of Walt Disney's Donald Duck".

Questions: Did Barks really ink this cover? Judging from the reprint in "The Carl Barks Library - Set VIII", the ink style seems to be different. Maybe Barks only made pencils for this cover, inked by another artist? (His wife GarÃ© Barks, for example?)

CBL-notes: According to an issue of "Der Donaldist", the editors of "The Carl Barks Library - Set VIII" have changed the Sowbuggian directions in the dialogue of panel 3.2 while retouching the story. (In The Carl Barks Library, the directions are "UMLX CYZK BCOUFSK GOO". It seems that the "U" in the "BCOUFSK" is in error.)

Research: The term or phrase "Penny Wise" dates back, perhaps to Ben Franklin's "Poor Man's Almanac"? (i.e., "Penny wise and pound foolish.").

Questions: What are the exact Sowbuggian directions in the original publication? Also, which issue of "Der Donaldist" contains this information?

Additional credits: Barks's list includes two entries for the front cover of Walt Disney Comics & Stories 165, Vol. 14, No. 9 - one for November 6, 1953, for "art", and one for December 31, 1953, also for "art". Barrier says the second listing is unquestionably the correct one, since it is identified as "kids with tools". Barrier concludes that the earlier listing is thus for another cover, possibly that of Walt Disney Comics & Stories No. 168, which is the only cover published at this time for which there is no entry on Barks's list.

Research: Both Perry Como and Liberace were very successful musical superstars even as early as the time of this story. Barks has acknowlegded their fame on the very first page of the narrative, in the form of the anthropomorphized "Perry Cougar" and "Lizardace", whose popularity the nephews use to goal Donald into striving for fame of his own.

Backstage: About hearing aids, Joseph Cowles wrote in a August 4, 2000 e-mail:

    "Barks had been burdened with a hearing loss from childhood. In the 60's he wore heavy horn-rimmed glasses with thick earpieces that contained built-in hearing aids. He said that they were quite expensive, and didn't work all that well - distorting sounds. Some days he could hear pretty well with them, other times one had to speak loudly or repeat things several times. Back then he didn't use the telephone, so my phone conversations were exclusively with GarÃ©. I imagine that eventually, with solid-state technology, his hearing situation may have improved."

Cross-references: Donald and the nephews decide they won't tell their new year's resolutions to each other, because of the troubles that aroused one year earlier. (1.1 - 2.2) This is a cross-reference to Â«solemn new years resolutionsÂ», published a year earlier.

Backstage: In the last panel, Donald tells his nephews to "Shut up!" Editor Alice Cobb forwarded Barks a letter from an irate mother complaining about the story, with a June 4, 1956 note: "We feel it is a fair criticism. We should all watch for this sort of thing, we think - and avoid it as much as possible". The mother's letter must have included a barb about the closing panel of the story, because the editor's note concluded, "In addition, we usually use 'Quiet!' instead of 'Shut up!'"

CZ WDC 196 "bobsled race"

Barrier: MBAC-199, 210
CBL: ---
Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: "Donald Duck"
Submission: 1955, December 15
Publication date: [none or unknown]
Issue: [none or unknown]
Pages: 10
Intended issue: [probably Walt Disney Comics & Stories 196, Vol. 17, No. 4]
Intended publication date: [probably 1957, January]

Changes: Listed in Barks' records as "Bobsled Race", the third unpublished story was a ten-pager submitted on December 15, 1955, and probably intended for "Walt Disney's Comics and Stories" No. 196 (1957). Barks wrote on this entry: "Don't know what became of this story. Probably scrapped."

In a letter from June 4, 1956, editor Alice Cobb in Western's West Coast office told Barks to tone down the clashes among the ducks, because an irate mother had complained about Donald's "Shut up!" in the final panel of the icetaxis-story published in "Walt Disney's Comics and Stories" No. 186 (March 1956). It would be around this time that the editor's were putting issue No. 196 together and so it seems likely that the bobsled story was shelved because because it involved conflict between Donald and the nephews.

Status: The story is lost.

Notes: Recently I've compared this story with the snow statue story which was published in WDC 196 (a story Barks submitted one week later) and it looks like parts of what could be a bobsled story are used in the snow statue story. More information will follow.

Questions: As far as I know, Carl Barks has never given a recollection of what happened in the story. If you've found out more than what is mentioned here, then please let me know.

Additional credits: In his 1969 list of work for Western, Barks wrote about this story: "I bought the basic idea for this story from my daughter who lived in Washington state."

Backstage: In panel 3 of page 4, a bus' destination is identified as "Hemet," a California town near San Jacinto, where Barks lived at the time.

Research: Panel 8.6 shows people not being able to open an inward door because of pushing against it in panic, which as a result also makes it impossible to open the door from the outside. In the USA there's a law which says that all doors in public buildings must open to the outside. Possibly, this law was made after the Coconut Grove nightclub fire in Boston in the early 1940s. One victim was the famous cowboy star, Buck Jones, the star of many movies (and comic books!).

I'll give you a few worthy maxims to remember!...
The road to succes is a speedway to the go-getter, but a quagmire to the laggard!
Let no grass grow on your sidewalks, nor moss between your ears!
To the brave belong the fair, and to the brainy, the raise in wages!
Be smart! Be active! Be in there pitching!

Submission: 1957, April 18

Additional credits: In his 1969 list of work for Western, Barks wrote about this story: "Got this idea from my daughter."

Backstage: In the beginning of the story, a radio service man helps the nephews play an april fool trick on Donald by faking a radio newscast. In a 1971 letter Barks mentioned a (text_s_radio_joke,default,similar joke) played on colleague Harry Reeves during his story department years.

Questions: Is the story's radio gag a recollection of this joke from the cartoon years, or did it also belong to the idea by Barks' daughter?

Pages: 10

Additional credits: If the machine-like font titles of the preceding issues WDC 229 to WDC 231 were made up by the editors, then "Under the Polar Ice" may have been the first WDC title made up by Barks himself after W WDC 46-02 in "Camera Crazy". See entry for W WDC 228-01 watchful parents club.

Other reasons for this theory: Apart from the creative lettering, the title "Under the Polar Ice" sounds more exciting than "The Good Deeds", "Black Wednesday", and "The Wax Museum", which only decribe the story's theme.

Changes: Art and idea front cover for "Walt Disney Comics and Stories", listed as "hammocks". It's difficult to say in which issue this cover would have appeared, since the covers which Barks submitted between April 1958 and April 1961 where noticeably printed out of order, but it could have been around issue No. 240.

It may be that the managers managed to confine their cuts to other stories in that issue. Only time will tell." No cuts were made this time.

Lost material: CZ WDC 249 Stranger Than Fiction [lost cut material]

Status: Original version is lost.

Backstage: As mentioned by Donald in panel 4 of page 3, the author of the science-fiction story "Ten Seconds to Mars" is "Spicer Willits", which is a reference to John and Bill Spicer and Malcolm Willits. They were three of the first comic fans to get in touch with Barks.

Joseph Cowles, who was also one of these fans, wrote in a July 29, 2000 e-mail:

The first time I visited Barks, must have been in 1960, he let me enter his little studio and look at the pages he'd finished for the WDC story he was currently working on. It was a story about a disintegration-reintegration machine, in which Donald got stuck. His butt was sticking out of the sending end of the device, and his head and upper torso were stuck in the receiving end. I was really moved by the beauty of his drawing. This was the first time I had seen it in black and white, and was amazed at how large the drawings were, how clean and precise his pen strokes were. That's when we first discussed his annoyance with the print quality of comic books. And, of course, the pages were shrunk down to 40% of the original art size.

Hero: [none]
Submission: 1960, September 19
Publication date: 1961, July
Issue: Walt Disney Comics & Stories 250, Vol. 21, No. 10
Pages: 1

Surviving material: Of this cover, which shows the nephews having stacked Donald's barbecue high with charcoal, a pen-inked pencil sketch exists. In this version, Donald also is carrying a long fork; there is more smoke coming from the barbeque; and - most important - the nephews are shown without charcoal dirt on themselves. This shows that the gag originally was that the nephews made piled up char coal so high that Donald's grill and steak won't fit on it. As published the emphasis lies on the gag that the nephews made themselves dirty while putting the char coal on the barbecue. Maybe the editor didn't find the cover gag visual enough and so they either added the dirt themselves or asked Barks to do it when inking the cover?

The pen-inked pencil sketch is published in Gottfried Helnwein's book "Wer Ist Carl Barks".

Additional credits: In a December 30, 1960 letter to Malcolm Willits, Barks wrote:

"I have just finished drawing two ten-page Donalds for Disney Comics that were scripted by an outsider. Editor Chase Craig sent me the two scripts while I was busy drawing the Gyro #3. I welcomed them as a chance to gain some time. Besides, I thought the writer might be some beginner who'd be encouraged by having his stuff used. Well, after days of rewriting and gag-propping on the scripts, all for free, I got them in shape and drew the art. Then, too late, I noticed on the border of one of the sheets the barely legible name of the author. It'd been erased, but I could make out the moniker of an old hack who has been around the game for years, and has never caught onto the duck style. Boy, do I feel let down."

Landmark: First appearance of Scrooge's competitor John D. Rockerduck.

CBL-notes: Crayfish and jellyfish added in panel 8.9.

Backstage: On March 19, the day before the story's submission, Barks wrote to Joe Cowles: "Tomorrow we're taking a ten-page Donald into Beverly Hills. That's the first trip into the city this year. I ran completely out of paper; so we have to go. I'm going to ask for a big stack so it'll be possible to give you a few sheets to get the measurements from, and to try out for drawing "feel.""

Correspondence:

    March 19, 1961 letter from Carl Barks to Joe Cowles

Questions: Has Barks ever commented on his creation of Rockerduck?

Submission: 1961, September 14
Publication date: 1962, April
Issue: Walt Disney Comics & Stories 259, Vol. 22, No. 7
Pages: 10

Changes: The title panel of this story was revised following office suggestions. In the original splash-panel, one of the nephews is holding a stick with a prune on it and the other two are standing next to him. They call to Donald: "All set, Unca Donald! See if you can shoot the prune off this stick with your arrow!" Donald, in the panel front right, replies: "Ha! A prune! I could shoot a raisin at this easy distance!"

The panel was presumably revised because it is extremely unsafe as originally drawn. The published splash-panel shows the nephews standing next to Donald as he aims at the stick - now stuck in the ground - there is no safety hazard.

A look at the art of the second panel (in comparision with the original first panel) seems to reveal that this panel was also altered. No original version of this panel exists, because - instead of drawing a new one - Barks has most likely revised it by whitening out the nephews and filling in the background.

Surviving material:

CX WDC 259 Jungle Bungle [surviving cut material]
    Rejected splash-panel.

Congruences:

Additional credits: Art-only front cover for Walt Disney's Comics, listed as "kids at bat". According to The Carl Barks Library - Set IX, Barks intended the cover for Walt Disney Comics & Stories 260, Vol. 22, No. 8, 1962, May

Surviving material:

CR CU 4 kids at bat [layout #1]

Status: No inked art is known to have surfaced.

Remakes: ARC BL 9 kids at bat [remake]

Backstage: Surviving pencil drawings for this cover show the nephews standing three in row, with bats over their shoulders, as Donald prepares to pitch. The nephews would severely injure one another's head if they swung their bats. Western probably rejected the design for that reason, believing that children might be encouraged to imitate the nephews' three-bat trick.

Additional credits: The cover idea for this art-only cover was already used in Italy, before Barks' version was published in the USA. This Italian version was inked by Italian artist Perego and published as the cover of Topolino #302, 1961-09-10.

Questions: It is obviously impossible that Perego had seen a published American version before. So, maybe this cover was distributed to various publishers just as an idea, possibly a rough sketch, which was then independently worked on by the various artists, including Barks? Also, who's the writer of this "international" cover?

CBL-notes: Splash panel is lengthened at the lower border. Changed from a Donald Duck-story into a Junior Woodchuck-story. Apparently, the reason for this is that the reprint of Junior Woodchuck comic No. 23 of November 1973 was used. Since it wasn't the opening-story of the comic, the room which was left open for the indicia of WDC 261 wasn't nescessary anymore and therefore filled in that reprint.

Research: In panel 4.7, Barks included a few bars of music. Matt Rosenblatt has pointed out that "The first seven notes are 'Twinkle, twinkle, little star': the melody comes from a Haydn symphony. The last three notes are the ones that follow in the symphony, but not in 'Twinkle, twinkle little star.'" Barks, questioned about this, replied in a 22 November 1968 letter to Michael Barrier: "The music from Haydn's symphony must have been lifted from the book 'The art of enjoying music' by Sigmund Spaeth. I used the book for many references to musical forms and titles. Actually, I can't read a note."

Backstage: During his visit to Holland in 1994, Barks was shown the at that moment most recent comic album "Beste Verhalen"-album No. 74. His reply, broadcasted on Dutch television, was: "Let's see. Something about it looks a little familiar. Yeah, I kinda remember this, something about litterbugging. That is an example of stories that just come up from various new laws we get in the States about throwing litter out on the highways, and how Uncle [Scrooge]... er, Donald gets in a jam, from somebody else's litter..."

Additional credits: Malcolm Willits' idea for a ten-pager about top-secret weapon plans became "Have Gun, Will Dance".

In an April 20, 1963 letter to Malcolm, Barks wrote: "I used the story idea you sent of the "lost" secret plans from the Pentagon. Sort of used the formula of the old-time Atom Bomb story from the Cheerio giveaway. You will find it very much like the 1940s style of writing, I think." (Malcolm Willits had sent Barks a copy of the Cheerio giveaway in November 1962.)

W WDC 280-03 Double Masquerade

Barrier: MBAC-187

Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1963, July 15
Publication date: 1964, January
Issue: Walt Disney Comics & Stories 280, Vol. 24, No. 4
Pages: 10

Appearances: beach (1.1); Sailin' Surfers (1.3); Duckburg Christmas Fund (1.5); Captain Ramrod and her troop of Junior Chickadees (3.6); Chickadee Christmas Fund (3.7); Santa Claus's Doll Factory (4.5); banking district (5.1); Mr. Goldsox, who gave hundred dollars to the Chickadee Christmas Fund (5.5); Mr. Jinglepurse, who gave fifty to the Chickadee Christmas Fund (5.5); Uncle Scrooge's private ski mountain (6.3); Uncle Scrooge's ski chalet, at which Donald worked a chair lift when Scrooge entertained big business tycoons there (7.1, 7.3); Uncle Scrooge's old mine tunnel, in which bears live (9.4); Duckburg steam rooms (10.6).

Backstage: Barks: "In "Double Masquerade" I used the seashore of Duckburg -- not too out of place for Burbank, which is a half-hour drive from the ocean. There was quite a fad for surfing at that time. The Beach Boys songs were very popular on the radio. Please don't be disturbed by the antics of a fictional surfing club. They 'kidnapped' their reluctant members in order to put up a united front for a good surfing show. I used their strong-arm methods as a menace to Donald's safety, a mere story gimmick."

The Beach Boys came from Soutern California and started in 1961. Up to Barks' submission, most or all of The Beach Boys hits were about surfing: "Surfin'" (1962), "Surfin' Safari" (1962); and "Surfin' USA" (1963).

Congruences:

W OS 203-02 in "The Golden Christmas Tree"
    Gold Christmas tree. (In "Double Masquerade", panel 4.6, one Chickadee mentions that she wants a "solid GOLD Christmas tree".)

Questions: In Barks' story, the surfing club is called the "Sailin' Surfers" and he seems to use a surf 'dialect' of that time:

    "Cowabunga! Dig those curlers, surfers!" /
    "Real gassers for hot-dogging and shooting the tube!" (1.2)
    "Where's your surfboard, Ducko, old surfer?" (1.4)
    "We've got a spare one and some baggies in the woody!" (6.8)
    "Donald Duck is shooting the tube with a one-foot stand!" (8.7)
    "Now he's WALKIN' THE NOSE!" (8.8)
    "And HANGING THREE with a one foot stand!" /
    "That Duck is the MOST!" (9.1)

In panel 5.7, Donald-as-Scrooge answers the Sailin' Surfers that he was just "foolin'" (note the apostrophe). I guess that the real Scrooge would have pronounced "fooling". Maybe Barks makes a gag here by showing Donald unconsiciously using the surf dialect when seeing the Sailin' Surfers?

Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1963, August 26
Publication date: 1964, February
Issue: Walt Disney Comics & Stories 280, Vol. 24, No. 5
Pages: 10

Landmark: Donald's early 1940s neighbour Mr. Jones appears for the first since Â«lost ten-dollar billÂ», not counting the unpublished Â«christmas caroling at peoples' doorsÂ».

Appearances: Papa [Jones] (6.4, on photo/painting); Maw [Jones] (10.3).

Backstage: A December 11,1960 letter to Larry Ivie shows that Barks had forgotten about this character: "You mentioned Mr. Jones. Glad to have him recalled to memory. I shall certainly use him again if a suitable plot suggests itself. Thanks, too, from Mr. Jones."

Research: The story's title is a pun on the idiomatic expression "Few and far between", the word "feud" having the same vowel sound as "few".

Cross-references: Donald says about his new neighbor: "I hope he's not like Jones who lived there long ago! Remember old Jones?" (1.2) The nephews comment: "You and neighbor Jones were in only one fight while he lived there! / That was from the day he moved in until he moved out!" (1.3) These are some of the story's cross-references to the 1940s stories with neighbor Jones [classic appearance]. Later in the story, Donald says: "If that's Jones, he'll be a sucker for my famous "fake injury" gag!" (5.7) This must be a cross-reference to a similar trick, in Â«borrowed puttyÂ» (8.4).

Submission: 1964, March 6
Publication date: 1964, September

Pages: 10

Research: This story is built around an American story of a Dutch boy sticking his finger in a dike to prevent a village from being flooded, written by Mary Mapes-Dodge (1831-1905). The boy had no name in the story, but in the same book there is another Mapes-Dodge story about Hans Brinker and the Silver Skates. By error, the dike-boy is usually called Hans Brinker. There is a statue of Brinker in the small town of Spaarndam, near Haarlem in the Netherlands.

Questions: Where does the tradition of the sea dragon originate from?

CBL-notes: Small, rather dark greyscale picture. The editors first thought the cover was not made by Barks, an error caught in time to include it on the greyscale "Errata" page, together with Barks' explanation of the awkward look.

Backstage: Especially the art of Donald's face has an awkward look. In or before 1990, Barks explained that he was in the process of moving when asked to draw this cover. He had dismantled his light table, and in order to ink the drawing had to place his pencil sketch against a windowpane, superimposing a sheet of Strathmore paper and to work vertically.

Additional credits: Previously unpublished cover idea pencil. A guess could be that the pencil was made in the late 1950s or early 1960s, and intended to be used as Gyro Gearloose One Shot.

Inked by an unknown artist. Since the arm on the scratching machine reaches up into the corner, this inked version apparently was never meant as a comic book cover, because the arm would have collided with the titles.

Years later, William Van Horn inked a new version.

Surviving material:

Intended publication date: [1948, September]

Additional credits: Alternate version of the cover published in "Walt Disney Comics & Stories" No. 96, 1948.

Surviving material: Original art, which Barks in 1995(?) hand-coloured with coloured pencils at the request of a collector. This coloured version has been published in "Walt Disney Comics & Stories" No. 627, 1998.

Backstage: In a January 8, 1983 interview with Bruce Hamilton, Barks said: "I drew the cover twice because I didn't get the proportions right the first time. I had the tub too high in the picture and needed more room to show the nephew and what he was doing."

On the published version, Donald's body is the eye-catcher. In the earlier drawing, it is lost in a mass of bubbles and shadow. In the published version there are also fewer bubbles, and a left hand extends outward from the body, so that more of Donald himself is visible. The shadow is gone, and the result is that Donald seems to float higher above the tub. To strengthen this effect, Barks raised the lower edge of his picture to cut off our view of the floor and show only the surface of the bath; he also lowered the window so that its sill is close to the edge of the tub. Now we seem to float with Donald, looking down. Eliminating the shadow and shifting the position of the window also enabled Barks to clarify the nephew's position and action. Now the curtain is visible on both sides of the aperture; and to leave no doubt that it is a window, Barks drew in the upper pane. He also extended the figure of the nephew to show his feathered tail, strengthening our impression that the kid is leaning forward.

Congruences:

    Original art hand-colored with colored pencils by Carl Barks in 1995.

Questions: As published in WDC 627, the date of Barks' signature at the left bottom corner isn't shown entirely. The signature seems to read "Colored by Carl Barks 1995". As only the top half of "Carl Barks 1995" is visible, it's a principal matter of debate if the date really is 1995. Is there someone who knows the date for sure?

Intended issue: [Walt Disney Comics & Stories 215, Vol. 18, No. 11] ?
Intended publication date: [1958, August] ?

Changes: This story was shelved in the 1950s. It would have appeared in or around "Walt Disney's Comics and Stories" No. 215. The intended issue number is difficult to guess, because Western was by this time publishing Barks's stories out of order. Barks's comment in his work records is that "this story was shelved because Donald was too mean to the villain." Detailed information

Status: The entire story has survived and was first published in Holland in 1974. It made its debut in the USA in "The Carl Barks Library - Set X"; and "Walt Disney Comics & Stories 550.

Backstage: About dairy products, Joseph Cowles wrote in a August 4, 2000 e-mail:

    Along with Carl's legion of allergies, he was lactose intolerant. and unable to properly digest dairy products. He loved milk in his cereal, however, and on the occasion of one of my visits was trying as a substitute, Loma Linda soy milk. I don't think he cared very much for it.
