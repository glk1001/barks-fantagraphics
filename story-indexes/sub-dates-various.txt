W CID 1-02 black pearls island

Barrier: MBAC-101
CBL: 06C-731
Type: story, three tiers per page
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1957, March 14
Publication date: 1957, (December)
Issue: Christmas in Disneyland No. 1  
Pages: 17 5/6
Filled out with: non-Barks transitional panel

Additional credits: Barks drew the story of Tabu Yama to fit a Christmas annual with a frame tale titled "Christmas in Disneyland", about Santa Claus taking two children to Disneyland. As Timmie and Taffy visit each section of the park, Santa reminisces about one or another Disney character having a holiday adventure. Various artists contributed these episodes; Barks was asked for a duck story to accompany the riverboat ride in Adventureland. Though the ride is meant to evoke African jungles, Barks set his story in the South Seas; but this seems not to have bothered his editors, who smoothed over the matter with a line about "tropical waters and the jungles of the world". The inlet of the story's last panel was filled with a transitional panel returning us to the frame tale. (In some reprints, e.g. in The Netherlands, this panel is replaced by new art.)

Layout: Doesn't end with a full page.

Questions: The splash panel of the reprint in The Carl Barks Library - Set VI contains a caption with the name "Donald Duck". Does this caption also appear in the original Christmas in Disneyland publication?

W CP 1-01 in "Letter to Santa"

Barrier: MBAC-101
CBL: 06C-633
Type: story
Art: Carl Barks
Script: Carl Barks
Hero: Donald Duck
Submission: 1949, June 1
Publication date: 1949, (November)
Issue: Christmas Parade 1 [Dell]  
Pages: 24

Layout:

Full page splash panel.
Contains freeform shaped panels.

Backstage: Donald and Scrooge were not the only hotheads to scrap with steam shovels. In 1926, Liberty magazine ran a cartoon by James Montgomery Flagg showing a similar battle of monster machines on a construction site in New York. Flagg was by this time a prominent illustrator and regular contributor to Judge, a magazine to which Barks himself would shortly submit cartoons.

When shown this drawing in 1985, Barks expressed surprise: "I had no idea Flagg ever stooped to such slapstick. No, I had never seen his cartoon, nor had I ever read Liberty magazine except in dentists' waiting rooms. The idea of steam shovels fighting is another of those 'naturals' that anybody should be able to think up."

Details: Scrooge seems to be wearing a Santa Claus coat in panel 15.8, judging the stripes on the fur on his right sleeve. They look exactly like the stripes on the Santa Claus clothes in the rest of the story.
Donald's boot shown on page 21 to 24, travels from his right-foot to his left-foot and back.

On the Disney Comics Mailing List, Larry Giver wrote: "Daniel van E. suggested a "visual error" regarding Donald's boot in Christmas Parade #1. After Donald and Scrooge fight in panel 1 page 21, parts of their Santa costumes come off, leaving each with only their coats and one boot each in panel 3 (strange how their trowsers can come off and still leave one boot on). In panel 7, page 21, Scrooge has no boots on at all, even though there was no additional fighting. Donald retains one boot on through to the end of the story. But probably the visual errors Daniel notices concerns which of Donald's feet has the boot. It's on the right foot in page 21 panels 3 and 7, but on the left foot in page 21 panel 6, page 22 panel 1, page 23 panels 1 and 7, and page 24 panel 5.
I recall a similar problem in some Mickey stories with Peg Leg Pete; sometimes the peg leg isn't consistently the same leg throughout the story."

Art: ["one of Disney's layout men"]
Script: Carl Barks, Jack Hannah, Nick George
Hero: Pluto
Submission: [unknown]
Publication date: 1942
Issue: Large Feature Comic No. 7  
Pages: 51

Additional credits: The entry for this black-and-white comic book (Large Feature Comic No. 7, published by Dell in 1942) in Comic Book Price Guide #11 says that it was 'written by Carl Barks, Jack Hannah, & Nick George."

In a May 17, 1981, letter to Michael Barrier, Barks told about the story: "Pluto Saves the Ship was written by Jack Hannah, Nick George, and I in 1942 in our evening hours. It was not an adaptation of a cartoon story. Eleanor Packer of Whitman Pub. may have dreamed up the basic plot. It was only a one-shot special designed to take advantage of the wartime jitters. Anyway, we three did the final draft in rough sketch form in my den room in North Hollywood. The post-Pearl Harbor blackouts were in effect, and we had all window blinds closed and taped shut. It was hot and stuffy, and we consumed many beers. The story shows the effects. One of Disney's layout men with a flair for drawing panel after panel of shipyard scaffolding did the artwork. I can't recall his name.

Because of the fact that we were only writing action gags to flesh out someone else's story line, none of us felt we deserved any claim to fame. I certainly forgot the whole business very quickly. As for payment, I doubt that we received more than a dollar a page."

Status: The script most likely is lost.

Pages: 3

Description: Re-inked version of page 1, 16 and 17 of W OS 29-01 and the Mummy's Ring.

Backstage: When Michael Barrier asked Barks why these pages are redrawn, he wrote in a February 17, 1972 letter: "I don't remember exactly, but I think the original printing plates were lost or damaged." Comparing these three new pages with the ones as they were published in 1943, shows a shift in inking style. Obvious differences are the Ducks' faces (see, for example, panel 16.6), the positions of the dialogue balloons, and the lettering. The only real change is made in panel 17.5. In the original version, the railing cuts through the ducks' necks, while in the redrawn version the ducks are positioned higher so that the railing is placed in front of their chests.
